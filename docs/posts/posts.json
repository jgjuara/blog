El AET 2021, con el que se retom√≥ la publicaci√≥n del informe anual estad√≠stico del turismo en Argentina (publicado entre 2005 y 2015), marc√≥ el comienzo de una ‚Äúsegunda √©poca‚Äù de este documento por su novedoso formato, completamente reproducible a partir de la difusi√≥n del c√≥digo fuente utilizado en su elaboraci√≥n. Este recurso fue el que ha permitido la pronta publicaci√≥n del AET 2022.\n\n\n\nCompuesto por nueve cap√≠tulos, el AET 2022 muestra la recuperaci√≥n del sector luego de afrontar la crisis provocada por la pandemia COVID-19, resultando el 2022 en un a√±o r√©cord en t√©rminos de turismo interno. Como muestran el cap√≠tulo 1 a nivel mundial y el cap√≠tulo 2 para nuestro pa√≠s, el turismo internacional sufri√≥ una ca√≠da mayor y su recuperaci√≥n demand√≥ un tiempo m√°s prolongado. Sin embargo, para Argentina puede distinguirse el comienzo de la recuperaci√≥n hacia el final del a√±o 2021. Por su parte, el turismo interno, presentado en el cap√≠tulo 3, en 2022 alcanz√≥ el nivel m√°s alto desde por lo menos 2012. El mismo fen√≥meno se observ√≥ en la ocupaci√≥n hotelera, abordada en el cap√≠tulo 4, donde las estimaciones de pernoctaciones de viajeros residentes alcanzaron el m√°ximo valor desde el inicio de su medici√≥n en 2004. En el mismo sentido, los cap√≠tulos 5 y 6, dedicados a las visitas a parques nacionales y al transporte a√©reo, dan cuenta de la reactivaci√≥n del sector, aunque a√∫n sustentan valores por debajo de la prepandemia. El cap√≠tulo 7 cuenta con la informaci√≥n de las agencias de viajes habilitadas en el registro del MINTURDEP. El cap√≠tulo 8 resume los principales indicadores econ√≥micos del turismo para nuestro pa√≠s en comparaci√≥n con otros pa√≠ses de la regi√≥n. Por √∫ltimo, el cap√≠tulo 9 presenta los datos de empleo en el sector hotelero, puestos de trabajo registrados, tasa de feminizaci√≥n y cantidad de empresas en las ramas caracter√≠sticas del turismo.\n\n\n\nCada uno de los cap√≠tulos cuenta con fichas t√©cnicas y est√° acompa√±ado del listado de recursos disponibles con los cuales se elabor√≥. En este sentido, el Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de Argentina pone a disposici√≥n la gran mayor√≠a de los datos contenidos en el AET, en diversos formatos: datos abiertos, reportes, tableros e informes.\nPara la realizaci√≥n del AET, se cont√≥ con la participaci√≥n de toda la DNMyE, que trabaj√≥ colaborativamente aprovechando las ventajas de los entornos de control de versiones.

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRESENTACI√ìN\nSe presenta el segundo informe de Crucerismo Mar√≠timo en la Argentina con datos de la √∫ltima temporada de cruceros (septiembre 2022 a abril 2023) (el primer informe refer√≠a a la temporada 2019/2020).\nLa informaci√≥n publicada surge como un sub-producto de los procesamientos realizados para elaborar las estimaciones de Turismo Internacional en la Argentina. Para eso, de la totalidad de los pasos internacionales del pa√≠s, se realiza una selecci√≥n de los tres puertos de cruceros argentinos: Puerto de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Puerto Madryn y Ushuaia y se aplican los procesamientos necesarios que permiten identificar a los cruceristas dentro de la totalidad de los movimientos de fronteras registrados por la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones.\nPRINCIPALES RESULTADOS\nLa estructura de este nuevo informe es muy similar a la que se puede observar en el de la temporada 19/20, destac√°ndose, en primera instancia, dos ejes tem√°ticos principales:\nVolumen y perfil de los cruceristas:\nEste informe nos permite monitorear la evoluci√≥n del crucerismo en nuestro pa√≠s. De esta manera, se aprecia c√≥mo en la √∫ltima temporada la actividad volvi√≥ a mostrar valores pre-pand√©micos, superando a la temporada 2019/2020 (y con valores levemente inferiores a los de la temporada 2018/19):\n\n\n\nAdem√°s, en los diferentes apartados presentados, la informaci√≥n se desagrega por puerto de ingreso, residencia, g√©nero y edad de los cruceristas.\nInformaci√≥n vinculada a las embarcaciones:\nEn este bloque la informaci√≥n se focaliza en las embarcaciones: principales caracter√≠sticas de las mismas (tipo de embarcaci√≥n, tama√±o, camas disponibles, cantidad de tripulantes); la distribuci√≥n de los cruceristas por tipo de embarcaci√≥n, crucero y compa√±√≠a naviera; y la tasa de ocupaci√≥n en camas.\nNUEVO ANEXO CON INFORMACI√ìN PROVISTA POR EL INSTITUTO FUEGUINO DE TURISMO (INFUETUR)\nDado que la informaci√≥n se elabora en base a datos provistos por la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones, no se registran movimientos internos de cruceros (ya que no suponen un traspaso de fronteras internacionales), los cuales tienen mayor peso en el puerto de Ushuaia que en los otros dos puertos, ya que en la capital fueguina es elevado el volumen de cruceros que visitan al Sector Ant√°rtico Argentino.\nCon el fin de visibilizar el fen√≥meno de los cruceros que realizan movimientos internos, como novedad en este informe, se agregan estad√≠sticas del crucerismo en el puerto de Ushuaia generadas por el INFUETUR a trav√©s de la Direcci√≥n de Planificaci√≥n y Desarrollo Tur√≠stico en base a datos elaborados por el equipo de investigaci√≥n de Turismo Ant√°rtico, de la Universidad Nacional de Tierra del Fuego, Ant√°rtida e Islas del Atl√°ntico Sur.\nEn esta secci√≥n del informe se observa c√≥mo, en el Puerto de Ushuaia, en la √∫ltima temporada se registr√≥ el valor m√°s elevado de cruceristas de las √∫ltimas siete temporadas. Tambi√©n se aprecia que los cruceros que realizaron viajes ‚ÄúAnt√°rticos‚Äù hicieron el mayor aporte al volumen total de cruceristas:\n\n\n\nDentro de este apartado tambi√©n se podr√°n apreciar datos vinculados a la evoluci√≥n de los cruceros registrados y la cantidad de recaladas por temporada.\nEl informe se encuentra disponible en https://biblioteca.yvera.tur.ar/, y se puede acceder al mismo a trav√©s del siguiente link.\nNUEVO DATASET EN EL PORTAL DE DATOS ABIERTOS\nLa informaci√≥n tambi√©n se presenta en el Tablero Interactivo de Crucerismo Mar√≠timo en la Argentina, con datos disponibles hasta la temporada 19/20 y proximamente se actualizar√°n con los valores de la √∫ltima temporada.\nAdem√°s, se creo un nuevo dataset de Crucerismo Mar√≠timo en la Argentina, en el cual se pueden descargar recursos en formato csv que refieren al volumen de cruceristas por temporada, mes, puerto, edad, g√©nero, condici√≥n de residencia, pa√≠s de residencia y crucero.\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nEl programa de preventa tur√≠stica que reintegra el 50% del gasto en servicios tur√≠sticos dentro del pa√≠s tuvo una cuarta edici√≥n, con el foco puesto en impulsar la actividad en los per√≠odos de menor demanda. El beneficio fue otorgado para aquellos viajes realizados entre el 24 de mayo y el 30 de junio, con la posibilidad de gastar la devoluci√≥n hasta el 31 de octubre. El tope de la devoluci√≥n fue de $70.000 para el gasto en agencias de viajes, alojamiento, vuelos y √≥mnibus de larga distancia, mientras que para el resto de los prestadores fue de $5.000 en total. El reintegro para personas afiliadas al PAMI se elev√≥ al 70%, al igual que en las dos ediciones pasadas.\nEn este marco, la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica publica los recursos que surgen del proceso de carga de viajes y comprobantes y del gasto del reintegro para esta edici√≥n, como lo hiciera para las tres ediciones previas. Los recursos est√°n publicados en el Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de la Argentina (SINTA):\nDatos Abiertos de Previaje\nüìä Recursos\nCantidad de comprobantes y monto total por fecha de carga y rama de actividad del prestador (seg√∫n el Clasificador de Actividades Econ√≥micas -CLAE- de AFIP a 6 d√≠gitos)\nCantidad de prestadores y establecimientos inscriptos por rama de actividad (CLAE a 6 d√≠gitos)\nCantidad de viajes y viajeros por mes de inicio, provincia de origen y provincia de destino\nCantidad de personas beneficiarias por provincia de residencia, grupos de edad y g√©nero\nCantidad de operaciones y monto total por fecha, perteneciente al consumo del cr√©dito\nEs importante remarcar que el proceso de publicaci√≥n de datos a partir de registros administrativos requiere una serie de procedimientos de consistencia, limpieza y anonimizaci√≥n, caracter√≠sticos de fuentes de datos que no est√°n inicialmente dise√±adas para su uso estad√≠stico. Estos procesos est√°n en constante mejora por lo que, en esta oportunidad, tambi√©n se revisaron los datos de las tres ediciones anteriores. Por otra parte, la difusi√≥n de los principales resultados (beneficiarios, viajeros, monto consumido) que se realiza mientras el programa se est√° llevando adelante, no cuenta con esta instancia de preparaci√≥n, por lo que puede haber diferencias entre esa difusi√≥n y los datos aqu√≠ publicados. Como fuera mencionado en la publicaci√≥n anterior, los datos son publicados de manera agregada y totalmente an√≥nima, de manera que no sea posible identificar a las personas beneficiarias ni sus viajes. En este sentido, fueron eliminados aquellos registros de personas beneficiarias que agrupaban menos de 3 observaciones.\nAlgunos resultados\nLos meses de mayo y junio son, hist√≥ricamente, los de menor demanda tur√≠stica. En promedio, la cantidad de viajeros hospedados en hoteles y parahoteles para esos meses representa alrededor del 60% en comparaci√≥n con el mes de enero. Existe, adem√°s, una gran heterogeneidad al interior de los destinos, algunos de ellos con actividad casi exclusivamente en temporada alta, y otros que presentan una variabilidad menor.\nLos datos de Previaje 4 muestran que, m√°s all√° de las diferentes magnitudes, algunos de los destinos m√°s elegidos en esta edici√≥n son distintos a aquellos visitados en Previaje 2, que resulta de inter√©s para la comparaci√≥n por su mayor preponderancia en la temporada de verano de 2022.\n\n\n\nDestacaron, en esta edici√≥n, las provincias de Salta y Misiones como las m√°s elegidas. La provincia de Buenos Aires, que fue la m√°s elegida durante Previaje 2 -con la Costa Atl√°ntica como principal atractivo- desciende al tercer lugar. La Ciudad de Buenos Aires fue otro de los distritos que aument√≥ su participaci√≥n. Resalta tambi√©n Santiago del Estero, que pasa del puesto 16 al 8, con las Termas de R√≠o Hondo dentro de sus actividades m√°s destacadas.\nDe la comparaci√≥n con la segunda edici√≥n, la de mayor volumen, puede resaltarse tambi√©n que, en Previaje 4, la participaci√≥n de cada provincia en los viajes fue m√°s equitativa: las 3 m√°s elegidas en 2022 representaron el 43% de los viajes (Buenos Aires - 18,8%-, R√≠o Negro - 15,9%- y C√≥rdoba - 8,6%-), mientras que en Previaje 4 sumaron el 31% (Salta - 10,9%-, Misiones -9,9%- y Buenos Aires - 9,8%-).\nPara poner en contexto la importancia de la cuarta edici√≥n del programa, puede analizarse una fuente alternativa de datos: aquellos que provienen de la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH), para viajeros residentes en nuestro pa√≠s. De all√≠ surge que el mes de junio de este a√±o mostr√≥ un r√©cord hist√≥rico en t√©rminos de viajeros hospedados y pernoctaciones para ese mes. Con respecto al mismo mes, pero del a√±o 2019 (prepandemia), en junio 2023 los viajeros crecieron un 11% y las pernoctaciones lo hicieron en un 14%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtro de los recursos de Previaje disponibles es el de los beneficiarios por tramos de edad. Es posible identificar, en estos datos, la creciente participaci√≥n de las personas beneficiarias de 60 a√±os y m√°s, en coincidencia con la incorporaci√≥n de un mayor beneficio para personas afiliadas al PAMI a partir de la segunda edici√≥n. En temporada baja, adem√°s, suele incrementarse la participaci√≥n de este grupo de edad.\n\n\n\nEste recurso se completa, adem√°s, con la agregaci√≥n por provincia de residencia y por g√©nero de las personas beneficiarias. La combinaci√≥n de la provincia de origen de las personas beneficiarias con los destinos de sus viajes nos permite ilustrar una caracter√≠stica distintiva del programa en particular y de la actividad tur√≠stica en general: su fuerte redistribuci√≥n geogr√°fica, desde los principales centros urbanos hacia m√∫ltiples destinos con menor actividad econ√≥mica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecursos disponibles\nLos datos abiertos de Previaje forman parte de un conjunto de recursos de turismo interno publicados en datos.yvera.gob.ar, que incluye turismo social, la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares y los datos que provienen del Certificado √önico Habilitante para Circulaci√≥n (CUHC) - Verano.\nüîó Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de Argentina (SINTA)\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\n\n\n",

Estos contemplan metas de reducci√≥n de la pobreza, la promoci√≥n de la salud y el bienestar de la poblaci√≥n, la educaci√≥n inclusiva y de calidad, la igualdad de g√©nero, el acceso a energ√≠a asequible y sostenible, el empleo y el trabajo decente, la industrializaci√≥n sostenible y la producci√≥n y consumo responsables, entre las m√°s destacadas. Los ODS cuentan, adem√°s, con 169 metas espec√≠ficas asociadas a indicadores que permiten evaluar su cumplimiento.\nEl turismo es una actividad que puede influir en el cumplimiento de los ODS de m√∫ltiples maneras. Adem√°s de la inclusi√≥n del turismo en 3 metas espec√≠ficas dentro de la resoluci√≥n original, la Organizaci√≥n Mundial del Turismo (OMT) profundiza en el aporte que esta actividad puede realizar a todos los ODS. En nuestro pa√≠s, el Plan Argentina Productiva 2030 (AP2030) tiene a los ODS como marco para cada una de las misiones que lo conforman. En particular, la Misi√≥n 11: Potenciar la actividad tur√≠stica para el desarrollo territorial sustentable a partir de la gran biodiversidad local propone un conjunto de proyectos con el norte de cumplir una serie de metas, muchas de ellas ligadas a los ODS.\n\n\n\nDocumento de trabajo\nEl Documento de Trabajo N¬∞12: El Turismo en los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible, aborda los ODS en el marco del turismo.

Esa secci√≥n, por otra parte, comenta la aplicaci√≥n para Argentina del marco ODS en la misi√≥n ligada al turismo del plan AP2030. La segunda secci√≥n se compone de una propuesta de indicadores relacionados con el turismo, que permitan evaluar la evoluci√≥n de los ODS con una periodicidad anual. Se detallan adem√°s, las fuentes de datos utilizadas. En particular, los siete indicadores propuestos toman como base a dos productos de publicaci√≥n frecuente de la DNMyE: la Cuenta Sat√©lite de Turismo de Argentina (CST-A), elaborada en conjunto con el INDEC, y la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVYyTH). Los indicadores buscan reflejar, por un lado, el impacto del turismo en la econom√≠a Argentina, en t√©rminos de PIB y de empleo (incluyendo su grado de informalidad) y, por otro, el grado de acceso a las pr√°cticas tur√≠sticas y su distribuci√≥n en relaci√≥n con los ingresos de los hogares. El documento describe las fuentes de datos utilizadas y muestra las series de tiempo de los indicadores elaborados, desde el inicio de la publicaci√≥n de cada fuente hasta el √∫ltimo a√±o disponible.

El Anuario Estad√≠stico de Turismo (AET), se public√≥ para los a√±os 2005-2015.\nEn esta nueva etapa se procur√≥ reiniciar esa publicaci√≥n, pero con una novedad: su formato principal -libro navegable a trav√©s de la web- permite un recorrido m√°s √°gil por sus cap√≠tulos, a la vez que la publicaci√≥n de su c√≥digo fuente permite la reproducibilidad y una base para actualizar a ediciones posteriores (o bien completar los a√±os que no fueron publicados). Tambi√©n es posible descargar la versi√≥n pdf y epub.\nEl AET 2021 est√° compuesto de nueve cap√≠tulos, precedidos por una introducci√≥n en la que se presentan los principales resultados, caracterizados en este caso por la irrupci√≥n de la pandemia COVID-19 iniciada en 2020 pero con consecuencias a√∫n m√°s severas en algunos indicadores de 2021. El turismo internacional estuvo pr√°cticamente paralizado, como se muestra en los valores a nivel global en el cap√≠tulo 1 y para nuestro pa√≠s en el cap√≠tulo 2. El turismo interno, presentado en el cap√≠tulo 3, si bien super√≥ los niveles de 2020, se encontraba a√∫n en valores hist√≥ricamente bajos. Lo propio ocurri√≥ con la ocupaci√≥n hotelera, que se aborda en el cap√≠tulo 4. All√≠ es posible distinguir la recuperaci√≥n de los viajeros residentes hospedados y la casi nula actividad de viajeros no residentes. En el mismo sentido, los cap√≠tulos 5 y 6, dedicados a las visitas a parques nacionales y al transporte a√©reo, dan cuenta del impacto de la crisis sanitaria. El cap√≠tulo 7 cuenta con la informaci√≥n de las agencias de viajes habilitadas en el registro del MINTURDEP. El cap√≠tulo 8 resume los principales indicadores econ√≥micos del turismo para nuestro pa√≠s en comparaci√≥n con otros pa√≠ses de la regi√≥n. Por √∫ltimo, el cap√≠tulo 9 presenta los datos de empleo en el sector hotelero, puestos de trabajo registrados, tasa de feminizaci√≥n y cantidad de empresas en las ramas caracter√≠sticas del turismo. La publicaci√≥n est√° acompa√±ada de las fichas t√©cnicas de cada uno de los cap√≠tulos.\nAsimismo, cada secci√≥n finaliza con el listado de recursos disponibles con los cuales se elabor√≥ cada una. En este sentido, el Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de Argentina pone a disposici√≥n la gran mayor√≠a de los datos contenidos en el AET, en diversos formatos: datos abiertos, reportes, tableros e informes.\nEl trabajo realizado cont√≥ con la participaci√≥n de toda la DNMyE, que trabaj√≥ colaborativamente aprovechando las ventajas de los entornos de control de versiones. Como fuera mencionado, el c√≥digo fuente del anuario est√° disponible para su reproducci√≥n o actualizaci√≥n futura por parte de la direcci√≥n.\n\n\n\nSe espera publicar en los pr√≥ximos meses el AET 2022, caracterizado por la recuperaci√≥n del turismo interno, que present√≥ valores r√©cord en muchos de sus indicadores.\nPara recorrer el AET 2021 visite el siguiente link.\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA partir de la colaboraci√≥n con la Administraci√≥n Nacional de Aviaci√≥n Civil (ANAC) dependiente del Ministerio de Transporte de la Naci√≥n, la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica (DNMYE) pone a disposici√≥n dos nuevos recursos, un documento de trabajo y un reporte, para el an√°lisis del mercado aerocomercial y el flujo de pasajeros en el pa√≠s. Los mismos, en conjunto al Tablero de Conectividad A√©rea del Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de la Argentina (SINTA), suponen una nueva fuente de datos para el estudio de una dimensi√≥n clave de la actividad tur√≠stica nacional.\nAmbos recursos utilizan datos que provienen del Sistema Integrado de Aviaci√≥n Civil (SIAC) y son facilitados por la ANAC. La DNMYE realiza un ulterior procesamiento de los mismos para reducir el universo de an√°lisis a aquellos movimientos a√©reos relevantes para la actividad tur√≠stica. Es por eso que, del total de movimientos registrados por el SIAC, s√≥lo se presenta la informaci√≥n correspondiente a movimientos de las principales l√≠neas aerocomerciales, excluyendo aquellos de vuelos charter, trabajo a√©reos, instrucci√≥n, vuelos oficiales y vuelos privados.\nDOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO\nEl ‚ÄúDocumento de Trabajo N¬∞11: Conectividad A√©rea. Diagn√≥stico tur√≠stico del mercado aerocomercial de Argentina.‚Äù, disponible en la Biblioteca del SINTA, realiza un an√°lisis descriptivo de informaci√≥n estad√≠stica vinculada al mercado de cabotaje y al internacional aerocomercial en lo referido a vuelos, pasajeros, asientos, rutas a√©reas y aerol√≠neas, entre los a√±os 2017 y 2023.\n\n\n\nEl an√°lisis de los datos muestra que, desde el a√±o 2017, el mercado a√©reo de cabotaje ha ido creciendo paulatinamente en t√©rminos de vuelos, asientos disponibles y pasajeros transportados, pese al parate que supuso la pandemia. Tal es as√≠ que, a mayo de 2023, la gran mayor√≠a de los indicadores han recuperado y hasta superado los valores previos a la crisis sanitaria.\n\n\n\nSin embargo, no solo los indicadores de desempe√±o han mejorado, sino que tambi√©n aquellos vinculados a la conectividad a√©rea. En la actualidad, no solo existen m√°s rutas a√©reas y m√°s conexiones federales que hace 4 a√±os atr√°s, sino que tambi√©n, el mercado aerocomercial se ha ido desconcentrando con la consolidaci√≥n de nuevos actores.\n\n\n\nEn lo referido al mercado internacional, la pandemia signific√≥ un quiebre abrupto en la actividad econ√≥mica. En l√≠nea con lo ocurrido alrededor del mundo1, la recuperaci√≥n del mercado a√©reo fue mucho m√°s lenta que en el de cabotaje y varios de los indicadores se encuentran a√∫n por debajo de los existentes a principios del 2020. Sin embargo, se espera que en los pr√≥ximos meses del 2023 se reactiven viejos corredores a√©reos detenidos durante la crisis, aumenten su frecuencia servicios existentes y se sumen nuevas conexiones y compa√±√≠as al mercado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn resumen, el continente americano y, m√°s precisamente, Brasil, Chile y Estados Unidos, se erigen como los principales or√≠genes y destinos inmediatos de los vuelos que van y vienen desde Argentina. A su vez, Aerol√≠neas Argentinas y, en una menor medida, LATAM, se ubican como las principales operadoras de vuelos internacionales, y, el Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarini de Ezeiza, como el principal nodo del pa√≠s.\n\n\n\nREPORTE\nDe manera complementaria al Documento de Trabajo, la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica elabora mensualmente un informe sint√©tico que re√∫ne los datos actualizados del flujo aerocomercial tur√≠stico correspondientes al mes previo a la fecha de publicaci√≥n, nutri√©ndose de las mismas estad√≠sticas de vuelos antes mencionadas en este blog. En esta oportunidad, se publica el √∫ltimo Informe Mensual de Conectividad A√©rea, correspondiente al mes de Mayo.\n\n\n@import

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nDe un tiempo a esta parte, desde la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica (DNMyE), en conjunto con el √Årea de Datos de Fundar, el Laboratorio de Simulaci√≥n de Eventos Discretos de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales de la Universidad de Buenos Aires y la colaboraci√≥n del INPROTUR, venimos trabajando en la explotaci√≥n de una fuente de datos novedosa que entendemos puede ser de utilidad para un mejor entendimiento del comportamiento tur√≠stico en Argentina.\nLa principal tarea consisti√≥ en la elaboraci√≥n de un flujo de trabajo que nos permitiera la explotaci√≥n de una base de datos de se√±ales emitidas por aplicaciones de dispositivos m√≥viles. En esta primera entrada sobre el trabajo que estamos llevando adelante queremos hacer una breve introducci√≥n y un ejemplo a trav√©s de un caso de uso simple que puede derivar de esta herramienta que estamos desarrollando. En una pr√≥xima publicaci√≥n profundizaremos sobre el proceso de descubrimiento de los datos, detalles metodol√≥gicos, limitaciones, desaf√≠os y casos de uso m√°s desarrollados.\nSobre los datos\nEl insumo est√° compuesto por tres grandes conjuntos de datos, con m√°s de 6 mil millones de registros, para una ventana temporal de un a√±o completo previo al inicio de las restricciones a la movilidad causado por la pandemia del COVID 19 en marzo de 2020.\nLos datos son especialmente atractivos por el alto grado de desagregaci√≥n espacio - temporal: contiene informaci√≥n diaria de coordenadas geogr√°ficas detalladas.\nPor √∫ltimo, vale destacar que los datos en cuesti√≥n provienen de una fuente especializada en el √°mbito del marketing digital. Esta recopila informaci√≥n an√≥nima de dispositivos m√≥viles que se identifican mediante un c√≥digo √∫nico denominado IFA (Identifier for Advertising), utilizado con fines publicitarios. Es importante se√±alar que no existe la posibilidad de establecer una conexi√≥n entre los registros de datos y las personas a las que hacen referencia. En consecuencia, la base de datos en cuesti√≥n no contiene datos personales y no es posible realizar una re identificaci√≥n de los individuos, ya que no se dispone de elementos que permitan asociar un registro espec√≠fico con una persona en particular.\nFuentes alternativas como complemento de informaci√≥n\nDesde la DNMyE se administran diversos operativos estad√≠sticos que tienen como objetivo la caracterizaci√≥n las diferentes formas de turismo: la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI) y la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH), en conjunto con el INDEC, y la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH). Todos estos, en conjunto, conforman el Sistema de Estad√≠sticas de Turismo de Argentina, insumo fundamental para, entre otras cosas, el desarrollo de la Cuenta Sat√©lite de Turismo de Argentina (CST-A).\nPara estas, de un modo esquem√°tico, las formas de turismo se clasifican de acuerdo al origen y destino de los visitantes: Interno (quienes se desplazan en el mismo pa√≠s que residen); Receptivo (no residentes que viajan al pa√≠s) y Emisivo (residentes que viajan a otro pa√≠s).\n\nAm√©n de la relevancia de los mismos, somos conscientes que, por diversas razones, los operativos tienen limitaciones para dar cuenta de manera acabada del fen√≥meno que busca medir.\nAs√≠, por ejemplo, si bien la estimaci√≥n del turismo internacional puede dar cuenta de los flujos para todos los pasos fronterizos del pa√≠s, la caracterizaci√≥n y perfiles de los turistas elaborados por la ETI se releva en unos pocos pasos a√©reos (Aeroparque J. Newbery y aeropuertos internacionales de Ezeiza, C√≥rdoba y Mendoza), en el Puerto de Buenos Aires y en el paso fronterizo terrestre Cristo Redentor, que limita con Chile. En conjunto, represent√≥ aproximadamente el movimiento del 46% del total del turismo receptivo en la Argentina (a√±o 2019).\nUn recurso como el que ac√° empezamos a descubrir podr√≠a echar luz sobre aspectos no alcanzados por el operativo estad√≠stico. En primer lugar, siguiendo con lo antes mencionado, porque podr√≠a ser el caso que las observaciones de la nueva fuente podr√≠an no haber sido te√≥ricamente alcanzadas si su egreso de Argentina (el momento cu√°ndo se encuesta al turismo receptivo) no se realiz√≥ por alguno de los pasos fronterizos antes mencionados.\nPor otro lado, la encuesta encuentra un l√≠mite razonable en el dise√±o del cuestionario impartido durante el operativo a los visitantes. En cambio, esta nueva fuente de datos, si bien no provee mucha de la informaci√≥n relevada por el operativo, si podr√≠a alguna de ella y eventualmente otra no contemplada, tal como mostramos en el ejemplo siguiente.\nCaso de Uso: Turismo receptivo en #LaRutaNatural\nUn primer an√°lisis para conocer mejor nuestros datos podr√≠a ser evaluar la participaci√≥n de cada pa√≠s de origen en el conjunto de datos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUn posible caso de uso de esta fuente de datos es el de generar informaci√≥n que pueda ser √∫til para el armado de perfiles de determinado tipo de turismo, en este caso el turismo de naturaleza. Si recurrimos a las fuentes tradicionales podemos encontrar informaci√≥n de utilidad al respecto. Por ejemplo, partiendo de la informaci√≥n de la ETI se puede identificar respondientes de la encuesta que manifiestan haber realizado actividades tales como (i) turismo aventura, (ii) actividades de baja dificultad en medios naturales, (iii) visitas a parques nacionales o (iv) actividades en la nieve; todas consideradas como relevantes para caracterizar el turismo de naturaleza receptivo, tal como se hizo en el Documento de Trabajo N¬∞1: Turismo de Naturaleza (DNMyE). Por otro lado, si recurrimos a registros administrativos tenemos la posibilidad de aproximarnos al fen√≥meno a partir de la identificaci√≥n de visitantes de los Parques Nacionales, tal como hacemos en el reporte de seguimiento en el SINTA.\nRespecto de la ETI ya mencionamos dos tipos de restricciones eventuales que el operativo tiene (cobertura espacial y l√≠mites del cuestionario). Por otro lado, la informaci√≥n de visitas en los Parques Nacionales surge del Registro Nacional de Autorizaciones, Recaudaciones e Infracciones (RENARI) de la Administraci√≥n de Parques Nacionales (APN), quien recopila y procesa los datos de visitantes. La informaci√≥n suministrada permite la clasificaci√≥n de las visitas en residentes argentinos y no residentes en 36 Parques Nacionales de la Argentina. En efecto, la fuente de APN es explotada para un fin distinto del que fue creado y resulta de utilidad para ello: permite dar cuenta lo m√°s fielmente posible del volumen de visitantes, con la posibilidad de apertura que distingue entre tipo residentes y no residentes (sin m√°s detalle sobre el pa√≠s de origen).\nRespecto de la fuente de IFAs que presentamos, tampoco se encuentra exenta de limitaciones. Sabemos que los datos que provienen de estas fuentes pueden presentar fuertes sesgos porque no vienen de una selecci√≥n aleatoria, ni estuvieron dise√±ados para responder el tipo de preguntas que nosotros queremos hacer. Sin embargo, entendemos que tiene la potencialidad de informar cosas que los recursos tradicionales no, tal como procuramos mostrar con el siguiente ejemplo, teniendo siempre en cuenta su potencialidad y sus limitaciones.\nParte del trabajo entonces es analizar los datos y en la medida de las posibilidades buscar validar su calidad a partir de otra informaci√≥n disponible. As√≠, por ejemplo, cuando analizamos IFAs relativos a turismo receptivo, buscamos compararlo contra la informaci√≥n que disponemos a partir de los registros de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones. El grado de correlaci√≥n entre las series nos ayuda a pensar al menos que los datos tienen un comportamiento an√°logo a lo largo del tiempo.\n\n\n\nEl siguiente mapa presenta una muestra de 10 mil se√±ales emitidas por dispositivos m√≥viles identificados con origen extranjero (pa√≠s de residencia del IFA)1. Cada punto corresponde a una coordenada geogr√°fica aproximada. El territorio argentino est√° a su vez delimitado por una capa de pol√≠gonos correspondiente a 16 de las 17 rutas naturales (se excluye el Continente Blanco).

idea detr√°s de este ejercicio es que podemos trabajar estos datos con la misma l√≥gica para cualquier pol√≠gono de inter√©s. A los datos de partida para el turismo receptivo (IFAs √∫nicos, coordenadas, origen y fecha) se pueden agregar otras capas ‚Äúpara hacerle preguntas‚Äù a los datos de partida.\nAnalizar visitas a Imperdibles\nAs√≠ como hicimos zoom hacia el pol√≠gono de una #RutaNatural espec√≠fica, podemos indagar sobre cualquier referencia geogr√°fica de inter√©s (y momento del tiempo del periodo abarcado por los datos). Siguiendo con el ejemplo de visitas a Parques Nacionales, podemos explorar muchos de ellos dentro de los ‚ÄúImperdibles‚Äù catalogados por el programa La Ruta Natural (Imperdibles - Patagonia Andina).\n\n\n\nEl uso de este recurso, siguiendo el argumento, nos permitir√≠a potencialmente estimar una proporci√≥n de los visitantes extranjeros por pa√≠s de residencia; dato no incluido en los registros administrativos con los que trabajamos usualmente. El siguiente mapa muestra, con distinci√≥n de nacionalidad de origen y fecha de visita, IFAs que fueron registrados en el interior de alguno de los Imperdibles de la Ruta Natural Patagonia Andina

El mismo se integra a herramientas y materiales ya existentes, como ser el MONITOR de estad√≠sticas de Turismo en las Provincias, o los recursos para el curso de Ciencia de Datos para el Turismo. La puesta a punto del sistema viene siendo conversada en reuniones de trabajo con las jurisdicciones. Las mismas suponen pruebas, ajustes, incorporaci√≥n de sugerencias, nuevas herramientas y capacitaciones.\nEl primero de los m√≥dulos est√° constituido por un gestor de datos estad√≠sticos de eventos y temporadas del turismo entre los organismos participantes. El segundo aborda la gesti√≥n de informaci√≥n de registros de alojamientos de las diferentes jurisdicciones.\n\n\n\n¬øPor qu√©?\nEn la experiencia previa al desarrollo de esta plataforma, el intercambio de informaci√≥n de esta Direcci√≥n con las distintas jurisdicciones se realizaba a partir de solicitudes de informaci√≥n estad√≠stica. Las mismas se realizaban a trav√©s de una nota formal por correo electr√≥nico, la cual se reforzaba a trav√©s de otros medios de contacto directos (mensajer√≠a, tel√©fono, etc.). Cada uno de los organismos provinciales y municipales de turismo enviaban los respectivos informes estad√≠sticos a trav√©s de distintas plataformas y soportes diferentes (archivos digitales con extensiones de procesadores de texto, planillas de c√°lculos, presentaciones, u otros formatos como pdf, jpg o audio) lo que dificultaba la recepci√≥n, elaboraci√≥n y procesamiento de la informaci√≥n recibida.\nEl objetivo es implementar un sistema homog√©neo y armonizado en lo referente a la metodolog√≠a de recolecci√≥n y an√°lisis de datos del turismo interno de los destinos tur√≠sticos de la Argentina.\nDEST: M√≥dulo de datos estad√≠sticos\nEl dise√±o funcional del m√≥dulo de datos estad√≠sticos del turismo (DEST) naci√≥ de un intercambio colaborativo entre la DNMyE y el √Årea de Datos de Fundar. El mismo consisti√≥ en un relevamiento de los procesos internos de intercambio entre la DNMyE y las jurisdicciones; un an√°lisis de los metadatos asociados al proceso; definiciones de roles, segmentos y problemas a resolver asociados; todo en l√≠nea con el dise√±o de un Producto M√≠nimo Viable.\nHabiendo avanzado luego en su desarrollo y pruebas piloto, mientras se avanza en el desarrollo de nuevas soluciones, DEST ya est√° siendo utilizado por √°reas provinciales y municipales responsables de las estad√≠sticas de turismo. A trav√©s del mismo informan a la DNMyE los indicadores que ellas elaboran sobre las temporadas estival e invernal, los fines de semana largos y otros eventos locales relevados.\n\n\n\nEl m√≥dulo DEST da un marco sistem√°tico e institucional para la comunicaci√≥n de estos indicadores mediante una interfaz sencilla y amigable, y que contempla la posibilidad de adaptar los indicadores y eventos o temporadas a lo que produce cada jurisdicci√≥n. Estos datos son usualmente relevados y comunicados al inicio y al cierre de cada evento y temporada, de forma que resulta fundamental una carga r√°pida y controlada de los mismos.\n\n\n\nAdem√°s el m√≥dulo DEST resguarda el historial de datos declarados y permite su descarga en formato tabular para que los usuarios puedan comparar, analizar y compartir la informaci√≥n relevada en cualquier momento. De esta manera, se facilita la comunicaci√≥n y gesti√≥n de los indicadores de la actividad tur√≠stica elaborados por los diferentes organismos, se promueve su estandarizaci√≥n y normalizaci√≥n, como as√≠ tambi√©n se agiliza su intercambio.\nM√°s m√≥dulos por venir\nYa en versi√≥n de desarrollo para iniciar proceso de pruebas, el m√≥dulo del Padr√≥n √önico Nacional de Alojamientos (PUNA) ser√° el pr√≥ximo en ser puesto en funcionamiento. El mismo est√° dise√±ado con el mismo objetivo que contempla el m√≥dulo DEST, como una herramienta que forma parte de la estrategia de Armonizaci√≥n para la recolecci√≥n, procesamiento, an√°lisis y comunicaci√≥n de las estad√≠sticas vinculadas a establecimientos de alojamiento tur√≠stico en la Argentina. En espec√≠fico, se busca generar una instrumento que permita mantener la actualizaci√≥n y compilaci√≥n de las fuentes de informaci√≥n que nutren, por ejemplo, el tablero PUNA.\nPor √∫ltimo, se planifica la creaci√≥n de otros dos m√≥dulos sobre los que se detallar√° en entradas posteriores: (i) Big data para el turismo y (ii) Inteligencia Tur√≠stica, en el sentido del desarrollo de destinos tur√≠sticos inteligentes, tal como proponemos en la MISI√ìN 11 del Plan Argentina Productiva 2030: Plan de desarrollo productivo, industrial y tecnol√≥gico.\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\n\n\n",

Esta clasificaci√≥n se construye a partir de las categor√≠as que registran las distintas provincias, las cuales se armonizan con fines comparativos y de an√°lisis. Adem√°s, esta clasificaci√≥n permite asociar la oferta de alojamiento con la elaboraci√≥n de estrategias de desarrollo tur√≠stico, por ejemplo, al hablar de Turismo Rural nos puede interesar poner foco en los alojamientos clasificados como ‚ÄúEstablecimientos rurales‚Äù, mientras que para el Turismo Social nos centrar√≠amos en los ‚ÄúHoteles sindicales/mutuales‚Äù.\nEn la siguiente tabla se caracteriza cada una de las 27 categor√≠as presentes en el PUNA de acuerdo a la cantidad de plazas, establecimientos y el promedio de plazas por establecimiento. De esta manera, se puede ver que las categor√≠as con mayor cantidad de plazas no son necesariamente las que tienen m√°s establecimientos o mayor promedio de plazas por establecimiento.\nPor ejemplo, los hoteles 5 estrellas cuentan con pocos establecimientos, en comparaci√≥n con el resto de las categor√≠as, pero son los que tienen m√°s plazas por establecimiento ya que suelen contar con muchas habitaciones y espacios para organizar eventos de todo tipo.\n\n\nhtml {\n  font-family: 'Encode Sans', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica

distribuci√≥n territorial de los establecimientos y plazas. En este sentido, los registros a partir de los cuales se recopila la informaci√≥n, brindan la posibilidad de ver los indicadores a nivel de Ruta Natural, regiones, provincia, departamento/partido o localidad. Sin embargo, no se cuenta con una geolocalizaci√≥n, a nivel de latitud y longitud, de todos los alojamientos.\nEn relaci√≥n a este punto, se trabaj√≥ en la georreferenciaci√≥n local del PUNA, para lo cual se utiliz√≥ la Base de Asentamientos Humanos de la Rep√∫blica Argentina (BAHRA) para asignar una ubicaci√≥n en el mapa a los establecimientos, a nivel de localidad. El ejercicio permiti√≥ geolocalizar a m√°s del 99% de los registros, en tanto se encontraron algunos obst√°culos a la hora de cruzar ambas bases (por ejemplo, localidades en PUNA que no constitu√≠an entidades en el BAHRA).\nDe esta forma, se pueden graficar los datos con mayor precisi√≥n, pasando de una agrupaci√≥n por provincia (pol√≠gonos), a una por departamento/partido (pol√≠gonos m√°s peque√±os), a una por localidad (puntos), tal como se visualiza en la siguiente imagen:\n\n\n\nA su vez, podemos bajar en el an√°lisis espacial hacia el interior de una provincia o departamento/partido, por ejemplo de la provincia de Buenos Aires y ver la distribuci√≥n de localidades registradas en el PUNA.\n\n\n\nL√≠neas de trabajo\nRespecto de la georreferenciaci√≥n, el ejercicio realizado abre las puertas para avanzar en al menos dos l√≠neas de trabajo con datos espaciales, a saber:\nCruce con otra informaci√≥n geogr√°fica para conocer conectividad, cercan√≠a a atractivos, etc., as√≠ como realizar an√°lisis exploratorios en el campo de la geoestad√≠stica para su aplicaci√≥n en la gesti√≥n del turismo.\nAvanzar en la asignaci√≥n de latitud y longitud a nivel de establecimiento, para mejorar la calidad de los datos y su an√°lisis.\nPor otro parte, desde la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica se viene trabajando en la elaboraci√≥n del Sistema Federal de Gesti√≥n de Datos Tur√≠sticos de la Argentina, un portal para la gesti√≥n y consolidaci√≥n de indicadores tur√≠sticos por parte de los organismos p√∫blicos nacionales, provinciales y locales.\nDicho portal cuenta con un primer m√≥dulo operativo que permite la integraci√≥n de datos de eventos y temporadas. Un segundo m√≥dulo apunta a gestionar los datos del PUNA, ofreciendo a los organismos la posibilidad de informar altas y bajas, realizar modificaciones, calcular indicadores y descargar registros. De esta forma, se podr√° administrar, consolidar y analizar la informaci√≥n de la oferta de alojamiento de una manera m√°s sistem√°tica.\nRecursos\nDocumento de trabajo\nDatos abiertos\nTablero\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\n\n\n",

Plan para el Desarrollo Productivo, Industrial y Tecnol√≥gico es un proyecto que procura transformar el entramado productivo del pa√≠s con vistas a mejorar los indicadores sociales, econ√≥micos y ambientales. Propone como metas generales a 2030 la reducci√≥n de la pobreza a la mitad, la disminuci√≥n de la indigencia en un 70%, la baja del desempleo al 5%, la creaci√≥n de m√°s de 3,5 millones de puestos de trabajo registrados en el sector privado y de m√°s de 100.000 nuevas empresas, la disminuci√≥n de las tres grandes desigualdades que tiene el pa√≠s (las territoriales, las de ingresos y las de g√©nero) y tambi√©n la reducci√≥n del impacto ambiental de las actividades productivas. Para lograr tales grandes metas, el Plan Argentina Productiva 2030 est√° organizado en 11 misiones productivas. El concepto de ‚Äúmisiones‚Äù refiere a que la resoluci√≥n de diferentes problem√°ticas (no necesariamente econ√≥micas, sino tambi√©n sociales y ambientales, como el cambio clim√°tico, el acceso a la salud, la defensa nacional, las brechas digitales, etc.) y puede ser una oportunidad tambi√©n para la creaci√≥n de capacidades tecnol√≥gicas y la transformaci√≥n virtuosa de la matriz productiva, para lo cual es necesario el trabajo coordinado entre sector p√∫blico y privado y entre diferentes sectores productivos.\nMisiones del Plan Argentina Productiva 2030\n\n\n\nEn este marco, la Misi√≥n 11 se propone como objetivo desarrollar la actividad tur√≠stica local partiendo del enorme potencial que Argentina tiene para promover el turismo de naturaleza como eje vertebral del desarrollo tur√≠stico.\nTras la pandemia, el turismo est√° renaciendo en nuestro pa√≠s y en el resto del mundo, y en la pr√≥xima d√©cada habr√° variadas oportunidades para potenciarlo y transformarlo virtuosamente. Se trata de una actividad profundamente federal, intensiva en la generaci√≥n de empleo, con mayores oportunidades para la inserci√≥n laboral de j√≥venes que otras ramas, y generadora de experiencias de bienestar individual y colectivo. El sector presenta varios desaf√≠os: si bien antes de la pandemia era un complejo exportador muy relevante, en la √∫ltima d√©cada fue una fuente severa de salida de divisas por la v√≠a del turismo emisivo. Asimismo, el impacto ambiental del turismo es considerable, a la vez que hay un importante terreno para recorrer en materia de incorporaci√≥n de nuevas tecnolog√≠as digitales, en la calidad de los servicios y en los encadenamientos virtuosos con otros sectores. Tambi√©n la actividad se caracteriza por una elevada concentraci√≥n en pocos destinos y por una alta estacionalidad, que dificulta la generaci√≥n de empleos estables.\nEl documento contiene un diagn√≥stico del sector, un an√°lisis de los proyectos productivos para el desarrollo sostenible del turismo que estructuran la misi√≥n, una secci√≥n de pol√≠ticas relacionadas con el desarrollo de la misi√≥n y, finalmente, indicadores y metas hacia 2030.\nDiagn√≥stico\nEl documento inicia con una descripci√≥n del sector en t√©rminos de su evoluci√≥n reciente a nivel mundial y en nuestro pa√≠s, luego aborda algunas de sus caracter√≠sticas m√°s salientes: diversidad de destinos producto de su gran biodiversidad, el desarrollo asim√©trico de los destinos, la alta estacionalidad que lo caracteriza, la infraestructura de transporte con la que cuenta, entre otras. Presenta, adem√°s, la contribuci√≥n de la actividad tur√≠stica en la econom√≠a en su conjunto, en el sector externo y, por √∫ltimo, describe los sectores involucrados m√°s relevantes: alojamiento, agencias de viajes y transporte.\nDestinos seg√∫n cantidad de plazas y proporci√≥n de turistas residentes hospedados\n\n\n\nProyectos productivos para el desarrollo sostenible del turismo\nCon el fin de alcanzar el objetivo propuesto, la Misi√≥n se desagrega en cuatro proyectos:\nProyecto 1: Incrementar el turismo sustentable en el pa√≠s y limitar el impacto ambiental de las pr√°cticas tur√≠sticas en su conjunto\nLa necesidad de reducir el impacto ambiental de las pr√°cticas humanas tiene un cap√≠tulo espec√≠fico en la actividad tur√≠stica. En este sentido, los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS), incorporan en la agenda hacia 2030 objetivos ambientales al desarrollo econ√≥mico y social, con el turismo como una de las actividades involucradas. La Organizaci√≥n Mundial del Turismo (OMT), a su vez, elabor√≥ un diagn√≥stico que puntualiza el aporte del turismo a cada objetivo espec√≠fico. En Argentina, la Ley Nacional de Turismo (n¬∞ 25.997) procura que la actividad tur√≠stica se desarrolle en armon√≠a con los recursos naturales y culturales y promueve el desarrollo sostenible del turismo en tres ejes b√°sicos: ambiente, sociedad y econom√≠a.\nEn este sentido, el turismo de naturaleza es un segmento estrat√©gico para el sector tur√≠stico de Argentina, y uno de los tipos de turismo de mayor crecimiento, tanto en nuestro pa√≠s como en el mundo. Este crecimiento es el reflejo de una tendencia global en la que los destinos naturales, los espacios abiertos y las experiencias genuinas en √°mbitos silvestres, permiten a una poblaci√≥n crecientemente urbana reconectar con la naturaleza y ocupan un lugar central en la preferencia de los viajeros, en parte debido a las consecuencias de la pandemia de COVID-19.\nEl proyecto referido presenta las estad√≠sticas disponibles del turismo de naturaleza en Argentina realizado por visitantes residentes y no residentes. Por otra parte, repasa algunas experiencias internacionales que tienen al turismo de naturaleza como eje de las pol√≠ticas de promoci√≥n y desarrollo de pa√≠ses seleccionados.\nEstas caracterizaciones, sumadas al potencial de los atractivos naturales del pa√≠s, en un contexto global de expansi√≥n del turismo de naturaleza, posicionan a esta actividad como uno de los segmentos clave para el impulso de la actividad econ√≥mica, el empleo, el ingreso de divisas y el desarrollo territorial en el pa√≠s a partir del turismo.\nParques nacionales y √°reas protegidas\n\n\n\nProyecto 2: Promover el turismo 4.0, la digitalizaci√≥n de empresas tur√≠sticas e incentivar la llegada de n√≥mades digitales.\nLa inclusi√≥n de la transformaci√≥n digital en la actividad tur√≠stica ha estado ganando cada vez m√°s espacio en las agendas de discusi√≥n de pol√≠ticas productivas para el sector. Las iniciativas sobre la confluencia entre las tecnolog√≠as digitales y el turismo tradicional se han incrementado sostenidamente en la √∫ltima d√©cada, con mayor relevancia en los pa√≠ses desarrollados. La Organizaci√≥n Mundial del Turismo (OMT), dependiente de la ONU, tiene como ejes de uno de sus principales planes de acci√≥n a la innovaci√≥n y la transformaci√≥n digital en el sector.\nEl documento revisa, en esta secci√≥n, la penetraci√≥n de las tecnolog√≠as digitales en el sector en Argentina. Por otro lado, describe las iniciativas de otros pa√≠ses para la transformaci√≥n digital de la actividad, con propuestas de turismo 4.0, destinos tur√≠sticos inteligentes, adopci√≥n de nuevas tecnolog√≠as, entre otras.\nEste documento trabaja, tambi√©n, con otro de los potenciales del sector: la atracci√≥n de n√≥mades digitales. Se trata de turistas que complementan su modalidad remota de ocupaci√≥n con sus deseos de conocer y recorrer otros pa√≠ses y culturas. Este segmento proviene de distintas partes del mundo, especialmente Europa Occidental y Estados Unidos, y cuenta con un nivel de consumo mayor al del resto de los visitantes, al tratarse por lo general de profesionales de ingresos altos que trabajan en servicios basados en el conocimiento, una actividad cuyas remuneraciones superan al promedio de la econom√≠a. Argentina cuenta con una amplia variedad de destinos tur√≠sticos y, a su vez, un conjunto de ciudades que podr√≠an funcionar como anfitrionas de n√≥mades digitales. El impulso de esta actividad permitir√≠a posicionar nuevos destinos que tengan la capacidad de albergar este tipo de turistas, por combinar una buena conectividad digital, de transporte, oferta cultural y poseer atractivos cercanos. Asimismo, podr√≠a contribuir a desestacionalizar la actividad tur√≠stica en destinos consolidados.\nPrincipal medio de venta de servicios, prestadores de los rubros alojamiento y transporte\n\n\n\nProyecto 3: Potenciar la vinculaci√≥n del turismo con otras actividades econ√≥micas\nExiste un gran potencial de integraci√≥n del turismo con numerosas actividades productivas en todo el pa√≠s, permitiendo vincularlas a atractivos de inter√©s cercanos y aprovechar la infraestructura para potenciar el desarrollo de destinos y productos tur√≠sticos, especialmente en zonas que desarrollan actividades ligadas a la producci√≥n primaria.\nEl proyecto analiza diferentes tipos de vinculaciones, especifica territorialmente su presencia y propone iniciativas para su desarrollo.\nUna primera vinculaci√≥n es la que existe entre actividades primarias y el turismo. Un ejemplo son las visitas tur√≠sticas a los establecimientos productivos, donde el caso m√°s desarrollado es el del enoturismo. En tanto, existen actividades que se desarrollan en zonas alejadas de centros urbanos, como la miner√≠a o la extracci√≥n de hidrocarburos, que demandan un desarrollo de infraestructura vial y, en algunos casos, de alojamiento para el personal, que permitir√≠an vincularlas como zonas cercanas que sean de inter√©s para el desarrollo tur√≠stico. As√≠ como estas actividades contribuyen a generar una infraestructura que ampl√≠a los potenciales tur√≠sticos, el turismo tambi√©n es relevante para ampliar las oportunidades productivas en tales zonas alejadas especializadas en actividades extractivas no renovables. Por √∫ltimo, se analiza el caso de las ciudades, mayores e intermedias, que no se caracterizan por tener actividad tur√≠stica tradicional desarrollada pero que cuentan con oferta ligada al turismo de reuniones (congresos, convenciones, ferias, exposiciones) y adem√°s tienen un desarrollo de infraestructura de transporte, as√≠ como una actividad cultural y recreativa de envergadura. Esto permite vincularlas como ciudades anfitrionas dentro de itinerarios tur√≠sticos que involucran otros destinos, y tambi√©n incrementar las visitas tur√≠sticas a estas ciudades.\nEstablecimientos con actividades primarias y tur√≠sticas, principales actividades\n\n\n\nProyecto 4: Aumentar el ingreso de divisas por turismo\nEn el mundo, el sector tur√≠stico es una fuente relevante de generaci√≥n de divisas para econom√≠as en desarrollo. En el siglo XXI se observa, tras la crisis de 2002 unos primeros a√±os con una balanza tur√≠stica relativamente equilibrada para nuestro pa√≠s. Durante la √∫ltima d√©cada, la balanza se volvi√≥ crecientemente deficitaria, acumulando un d√©ficit de 23.500 millones entre 2011 y 2020. El d√©ficit toc√≥ un m√°ximo de m√°s de USD 6.000 millones en 2017, previo a la crisis cambiaria de 2018-2019. En efecto, parte importante de la escasez de d√≥lares que caracteriz√≥ a la econom√≠a argentina durante la √∫ltima d√©cada tuvo que ver con el severo desbalance comercial del sector tur√≠stico.\nEl aporte del documento se centra en la descripci√≥n de los distintos mercados de origen de nuestros visitantes internacionales, mostrando la evoluci√≥n de las llegadas, el gasto de los turistas, su estad√≠a promedio, el rango etario, entre otros indicadores.\nSe presenta, adem√°s, un estudio de los determinantes macroecon√≥micos del turismo internacional en el pa√≠s, en particular, el efecto que tienen las variaciones de los ingresos y del tipo de cambio en el turismo receptivo y emisivo.\nLas conclusiones, presentadas en t√©rminos orientativos en el documento, consideran que se puede extraer de estos an√°lisis una lecci√≥n de pol√≠tica p√∫blica para tener en cuenta, y que tienen que ver con las complicaciones derivadas de tener procesos sostenidos de apreciaci√≥n cambiaria real en materia de divisas ligadas al turismo. Sobre estas bases se plantean m√°s adelante las metas para el sector hacia 2030 y las pol√≠ticas para contribuir a alcanzarlas.\nEvoluci√≥n de los ingresos y egresos por turismo internacional (millones de USD)\n\n\n\nPol√≠ticas de turismo hacia un Plan 2030\nLas pol√≠ticas rese√±adas en el documento dan cuenta de programas, acciones y medidas que persiguen los objetivos planteados, y se encadenan secuencialmente a partir de la afectaci√≥n que la pandemia COVID-19 tuvo sobre el sector tur√≠stico. Ejemplo de estas son las pol√≠ticas de sostenimiento (como APTur, FACT, PreViaje), que se implementaron para transitar el shock negativo y la transici√≥n; el dise√±o de nuevas pol√≠ticas de desarrollo que buscan atacar ciertos d√©ficits y acompa√±ar nuevas formas de turismo; la ejecuci√≥n de estos nuevos programas y la generaci√≥n continua de nuevas herramientas. Aunque, los diversos proyectos y metas est√°n vinculados con m√∫ltiples acciones, el documento est√° transversalmente basado en algunas pol√≠ticas espec√≠ficas. En este sentido, el programa La Ruta Natural juega un rol central. En buena medida este funciona como paraguas de muchas de las iniciativas que se describen en el documento, articulando acciones de diagn√≥stico y planteo estrat√©gico, calidad, desarrollo de infraestructura, promoci√≥n interna y externa. El programa fue elaborado bajo la premisa de que el sector tiene una din√°mica territorial particular y que debe ser el territorio, con sus caracter√≠sticas espec√≠ficas, el eje ordenador de una estrategia integral de promoci√≥n y desarrollo que persiga los objetivos ambientales, socioculturales, de calidad y socioecon√≥micos que requiere el desarrollo sustentable, con un abordaje federal y con la capacidad de vinculaci√≥n de diversos sectores y actividades productivas.\nOtras iniciativas del Ministerio forman la columna vertebral de la misi√≥n: el Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de Argentina es un conjunto de herramientas y plataformas que facilitan el acceso a datos e informaci√≥n tur√≠stica de Argentina. El Sistema Argentino de Calidad Tur√≠stica (SACT), un conjunto de herramientas orientadas a la mejora en la competitividad de las organizaciones que forman parte de la cadena de valor del turismo, cuya implementaci√≥n se trabaja en conjunto entre el Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes y las jurisdicciones provinciales, aporta sus recomendaciones a la totalidad de los proyectos de la misi√≥n.\nLas pol√≠ticas rese√±adas se complementan, adem√°s, con otros programas del Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes y, a modo de propuestas, se describen lineamientos de pol√≠ticas a implementar en el futuro para lograr los objetivos propuestos en cada uno de los proyectos. Se trata, por lo tanto, de una mirada que busca integrar lo hecho hasta aqu√≠ con una agenda de futuro para los pr√≥ximos a√±os.\nIndicadores y metas hacia 2030\nEn l√≠nea con el esp√≠ritu general del Plan, la misi√≥n plantea un conjunto de metas a alcanzar en el a√±o 2030. La implementaci√≥n de las pol√≠ticas rese√±adas en este documento, persiguiendo los cuatro proyectos presentados, procuran alcanzar, adem√°s, una serie de objetivos generales para el sector tur√≠stico en el pa√≠s, relativos a su contribuci√≥n econ√≥mica en t√©rminos de actividad, empleo, exportaciones y a la estacionalidad de la actividad tur√≠stica.\nMetas a 2030 de la Misi√≥n 11\n\n\n\nEl documento tambi√©n forma parte de la serie de Documentos de Trabajo de la DNMyE, disponibles en https://biblioteca.yvera.tur.ar/.\nSe puede acceder al documento en el siguiente link\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\n\n\n",

Con ese fin, presentamos el Informe de Crucerismo Mar√≠timo en la Argentina con datos actualizados a la temporada 2019/2020.\nPRINCIPALES RESULTADOS\nAntes de comenzar con la descripci√≥n del contenido del informe, se deben hacer algunas aclaraciones:\nSolo se presentan datos vinculados al crucerismo mar√≠timo en nuestro pa√≠s, quedando de esta manera excluido el crucerismo fluvial.\nAl utilizar como insumo los datos aportados por la DNM, no es incluida informaci√≥n vinculada a los cruceristas transportados por cruceros que realizaron movimientos internos (la DNM solo registra los movimientos que suponen traspasar las fronteras argentinas). Este punto es importante, ya que podr√°n observarse diferencias con la informaci√≥n de cruceristas provenientes de otras fuentes.\nHechas estas aclaraciones, en el informe de Crucerismo en la Argentina encontrar√°n, en primera instancia, informaci√≥n relacionada a la evoluci√≥n de los cruceristas en el pa√≠s desde la temporada 2015/16 hasta la temporada 2019/20:\n\n\n\nYa que que los datos presentan marcados matices seg√∫n el puerto de crucero analizado, la gran mayor√≠a de la informaci√≥n se presenta diferenciada por puerto, en este caso, en el mapa se observa la cantidad de cruceristas, recaladas y cruceros registrados seg√∫n puerto en la temporada 19/20:\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"setView\":[[-42.5,-64.49],3,[]],\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://wms.ign.gob.ar/geoserver/gwc/service/tms/1.0.0/mapabase_gris@EPSG%3A3857@png/{z}/{x}/{-y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false}]},{\"method\":\"addMarkers\",\"args\":[[-34.5799392,-42.7373834,-54.8089966],[-58.3707258,-65.0391528,-68.3033648],null,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"draggable\":false,\"keyboard\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"\",\"zIndexOffset\":0,\"opacity\":1,\"riseOnHover\":false,\"riseOffset\":250},[\"<b>Puerto Buenos Aires<\\/b><br>Cruceristas: 361.060<br>Recaladas: 117<br>Cruceros: 36\",\"<b>Puerto Madryn<\\/b><br>Cruceristas:  52.304<br>Recaladas: 33<br>Cruceros: 16\",\"<b>Ushuaia<\\/b><br>Cruceristas: 106.577<br>Recaladas: 162<br>Cruceros: 46\"],null,null,null,[\"<b>Puerto Buenos Aires<\\/b><br>Cruceristas: 361.060<br>Recaladas: 117<br>Cruceros: 36\",\"<b>Puerto Madryn<\\/b><br>Cruceristas:  52.304<br>Recaladas: 33<br>Cruceros: 16\",\"<b>Ushuaia<\\/b><br>Cruceristas: 106.577<br>Recaladas: 162<br>Cruceros: 46\"],{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[-54.8089966,-34.5799392],\"lng\":[-68.3033648,-58.3707258]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nAl ser una actividad vinculada al turismo, el crucerismo esta marcado por la estacionalidad.

que la informaci√≥n que se encuentra en el informe surge como una ramificaci√≥n de los datos de turismo internacional, los datos de perfil de los cruceristas presentan similares aperturas a las que se pueden observar en los diversos productos de turismo internacional generados por la DNMyE.\nDe esta manera, se puede conocer qu√© mercados participan en el crucerismo en nuestro pa√≠s: la mayor√≠a de los cruceristas son no residentes en la Argentina, de los cuales se destacan los residentes en Brasil y Estados Unidos:\n\n\n\nLos datos tambi√©n se segmentan seg√∫n g√©nero, y se destaca que m√°s de la mitad de los cruceristas son de g√©nero femenino:\n\n\n\nEn lo que respecta al grupo etario, se evidencia que la mayor√≠a de los cruceristas son mayores de 59 a√±os:\n\n\n\nJunto con la informaci√≥n de perfil de los cruceristas, en el informe tambi√©n se presentan datos relacionados a la distribuci√≥n de cruceristas seg√∫n tipo de embarcaci√≥n. Para esto, se aplican distintos criterios de clasificaci√≥n de las embarcaciones, por ejemplo, el tama√±o: se diferenci√≥ a los Very Large Cruise Vessel (VLCV), que ser√≠an las embarcaciones m√°s grandes, con m√°s de 100.000 GT (gross tonnage, una unidad de medida estandarizada del tama√±o de los cruceros); del resto de las embarcaciones m√°s peque√±as. Considerando este criterio de segmentaci√≥n, se observa que en la temporada 2019/20 los cruceros de mayor tama√±o transportaron aproximadamente 1 de cada 3 cruceristas:\n\n\n\nGracias a la informaci√≥n presentada, tambi√©n podemos conocer el top 5 de cruceros que transportaron mayor cantidad de cruceristas, destacando al Costa Pac√≠fica, el MSC M√∫sica, Celebrity Eclipse, Norwegian Star y el MSC Poesia:\n\n\n\nMismo ejercicio se realiz√≥ para dar cuenta de la distribuci√≥n de pasajeros por compa√±√≠a naviera, apreciando el peso de MSC y Costa:\n\n\n\nFinalmente, se debe aclarar que estos informes se actualizar√°n anualmente (meses despu√©s de haber finalizado la temporada de cruceros) y esta primera publicaci√≥n refiere a la temporada 2019/20, ya que durante las temporadas 2020/21 y 2021/22 el movimiento de cruceros fue pr√°cticamente nulo debido a la situaci√≥n de p√∫blico conocimiento del COVID. Se espera una normalizaci√≥n de la actividad en la temporada 2022/23, por lo que el pr√≥ximo informe se publicar√° luego de haber finalizado la misma.\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\n\n\n",

W. (1980): ‚ÄúThe concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources‚Äù, Canadian Geographies / Les g√©ographies canadiennes, 24, 1, pp.¬†5-12, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1541-0064.1980.tb00970.x.\nLas tres categor√≠as suponen niveles de maduraci√≥n crecientes del destino tur√≠stico en t√©rminos de sus capacidades: la categor√≠a de emergente comprende las fases de exploraci√≥n (I) e implicaci√≥n (II), la categor√≠a en desarrollo a la fase de desarrollo (III) y finalmente la categor√≠a de consolidada que comprende a las fases de consolidaci√≥n (IV), estancamiento (V), declive (VI) y rejuvenecimiento (VII).\nEstrategia\nSe evaluaron diferentes indicadores generados por la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica que pod√≠an servir para clasificar las localidades considerando su regularidad de actualizaci√≥n, la granularidad y la cobertura geogr√°fica. De ellos los principales candidatos fueron la cantidad de plazas de alojamiento a partir de PUNA, la tasa de ocupaci√≥n hotelera y la estad√≠a promedio a partir de la EOH, la estacionalidad de la oferta y la demanda (ver Documento de Trabajo N¬∞ 6), y la disponibilidad de medios de transporte (por ejemplo en funci√≥n de los datos del Tablero de Conectividad).\nDe estos indicadores posibles la cantidad de plazas de alojamiento se eligi√≥ como mejor indicador para realizar el ejercicio de clasificaci√≥n unidimensional, ya que presentaba continuidad en el tiempo, granularidad geogr√°fica a nivel localidad, y una amplia cobertura geogr√°fica (m√°s de un 36% de las localidades del pa√≠s).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mapa de cobertura de localidades por el PUNA\n\n\n\nFuente: Elaboraci√≥n propia en base a datos de BAHRA y PUNA.\nUna vez elegido el mejor indicador disponible se procedi√≥ a analizar la distribuci√≥n del mismo a fin de entender el mejor mecanismo de corte para la clasificaci√≥n en funci√≥n de la variable elegida. El objetivo fue hallar un m√©todo que permitiera dividir la distribuci√≥n en tres secciones que se correspondan con las tres categor√≠as de nivel de desarrollo tur√≠stico. Se opt√≥ por usar un algoritmo de clasificaci√≥n espec√≠fico para distribuciones de colas pesadas llamado ‚ÄúHead-Tails‚Äù.\nClasificaci√≥n de localidades por plazas de alojamiento\n\n\n\nFuente: Elaboraci√≥n propia en base a datos de PUNA.\nResultados\nSobre la clasificaci√≥n obtenida mediante el algoritmo de ‚ÄúHead-Tails‚Äù se realiz√≥ un an√°lisis de los casos con valores cercanos a los puntos de corte en funci√≥n de considerar especificidades de los mismos que no estuvieran reflejados en su cantidad de plazas de alojamiento. En funci√≥n de ese an√°lisis se corrigieron marginalmente los puntos de corte para llegar a una nueva clasificaci√≥n.\nMediante esa correcci√≥n se lleg√≥ a la siguiente distribuci√≥n de la clasificaci√≥n de las localidades PUNA: 1089 localidades en la categor√≠a emergente, 115 localidades en la categor√≠a en desarrollo y 78 localidades en la categor√≠a consolidado. Se puede observar en el siguiente mapa la distribuci√≥n espacial que resulta de la clasificaci√≥n realizada.\nDistribuci√≥n geogr√°fica de las localidades clasificadas\n\n\n\nFuente: Elaboraci√≥n propia en base a datos de BAHRA y PUNA.\nPara mejorar la clasificaci√≥n realizada en este primer ejercicio se est√°n elaborando nuevos indicadores que permitir√°n realizar un an√°lisis multidimensional del nivel de desarrollo de las localidades y su seguimiento a lo largo del tiempo.\nEn tal sentido las pr√≥ximas iteraciones de la propuesta de clasificaci√≥n del nivel desarrollo de destinos tur√≠sticos procurar√° incorporar indicadores como: (i) distancia de cada localidad respecto a un aeropuerto y/o puerto; (ii) desarrollo de v√≠as terrestres; (iii) cantidad de empresas de ramas caracter√≠sticas del turismo y (iv) disponibilidad de servicio de internet y de centros de salud.\nüîó Documento de Trabajo N¬∞8\nSe puede descargar el documento Clasificaci√≥n de localidades seg√∫n nivel de desarrollo tur√≠stico de la BIBLIOTECA del Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de Argentina (SINTA) https://biblioteca.yvera.tur.ar/\nüîó Recursos\nPadr√≥n √önico Nacional de Alojamiento (PUNA)\nEncuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH)\nTablero de Conectividad A√©rea\nDocumento de Trabajo N¬∞6: Estacionalidad en Turismo.

El impacto de la pandemia, especialmente severo en el sector tur√≠stico, requiri√≥ de la primera edici√≥n del programa para garantizar la temporada alta de 2021, per√≠odo en el cual la incertidumbre sobre la evoluci√≥n de la pandemia a√∫n requer√≠a limitaciones a la circulaci√≥n de personas. La reactivaci√≥n del sector coincidi√≥ con la segunda edici√≥n, que transcurri√≥ entre los √∫ltimos meses de 2021 y durante 2022. Por √∫ltimo, Previaje 3 se lanz√≥ entre septiembre y noviembre de 2022, con el objetivo de suavizar la estacionalidad de la demanda, caracter√≠stica saliente de esta actividad. En adelante, el objetivo de elevar la actividad tur√≠stica en temporada baja marcar√° futuras ediciones.\nEl proceso de carga de los comprobantes para obtener el cr√©dito correspondiente incluy√≥ la carga de un conjunto de datos de las personas beneficiarias -como la ubicaci√≥n de residencia, edad, g√©nero- y sus viajes -las fechas de inicio y finalizaci√≥n, el origen y el o los destinos, caracter√≠sticas del grupo de viaje, entre otras- y de los prestadores -la actividad a la que pertenecen, ubicaci√≥n, etc.-.\nPor otro lado, cada gasto del cr√©dito otorgado es registrado por las procesadoras de medios de pago a la que pertenecen las tarjetas de cr√©dito asociadas a las cuentas de acreditaci√≥n del beneficio.\nA partir de estos datos, la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica (DNMyE), pone a disposici√≥n un conjunto de recursos con algunas de las variables m√°s relevantes que surgen del proceso de carga y del gasto del cr√©dito. Se trata, en todos los casos, de datos agregados y totalmente an√≥nimos, de manera que no sea posible identificar a las personas beneficiarias ni sus viajes. En este sentido, fueron eliminados aquellos registros que agrupaban menos de 3 observaciones.\nEn esta oportunidad, se presentan 5 recursos:\nDatos Abiertos de Previaje\nüìä Recursos\nCantidad de comprobantes y monto total por fecha de carga y rama de actividad del prestador (seg√∫n el Clasificador de Actividades Econ√≥micas -CLAE- de AFIP a 6 d√≠gitos)\nCantidad de prestadores y establecimientos inscriptos por rama de actividad (CLAE a 6 d√≠gitos)\nCantidad de viajes y viajeros por mes de inicio, provincia de origen y provincia de destino\nCantidad de personas beneficiarias por provincia de residencia, grupos de edad y g√©nero\nCantidad de operaciones y monto total por fecha, perteneciente al consumo del cr√©dito\nLos distintos recursos ya publicados por la DNMyE, relativos al turismo interno, la ocupaci√≥n hotelera, as√≠ como el resto de los recursos del Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de la Argentina (SINTA), servir√°n para poner en contexto la contribuci√≥n del programa.\nDatos abiertos de turismo en Argentina\nüìä EVyTH\nüìä EOH\nüìä Portal datos abiertos\nAlgunas aplicaciones de los datos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl primer recurso, que cuenta la cantidad de comprobantes y el monto total por fecha de carga, permite dimensionar la magnitud de las tres ediciones. En la primera edici√≥n se cargaron 262.053 comprobantes por un total de $10.010,7 millones. La segunda edici√≥n fue la de mayor tama√±o, con un total de 2.032.282 comprobantes por\n$98.864,5 millones. La tercera edici√≥n, concentrada en viajes de octubre y noviembre, tuvo cargas de 430.885 comprobantes y una facturaci√≥n de $25.793,7 millones. En t√©rminos reales, el monto de los comprobantes de la segunda edici√≥n fue 6 veces superior a la primera y 7 veces mayor que la tercera.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa participaci√≥n de los prestadores en el programa fue elevada desde la primera edici√≥n. En ella, se inscribieron 12.932 prestadores, mientras que en la segunda lo hicieron 13.147, los que a su vez sumaron 14.409 establecimientos y en la tercera 12.240 con 13.493 establecimientos3. Observando la participaci√≥n por rama de actividad, en la segunda edici√≥n se inscribieron 8.426 establecimientos del rubro alojamiento, un 58% del total. La actividad de agencias de viajes y servicios asociados tuvieron 4.528 establecimientos inscriptos, un 31% del total. El restante 11% de los inscriptos se reparti√≥ entre servicios de transporte, alquiler de veh√≠culos, servicios art√≠sticos recreativos y culturales, entre otros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEs posible, tambi√©n, hacer un an√°lisis de las personas beneficiarias que se inscribieron en cada una de las ediciones del programa. Puede verse su distribuci√≥n territorial, por g√©nero y por edad. En la primera edici√≥n se inscribieron 193.911 personas, mientras que en la segunda lo hicieron 1.287.475 y en la tercera 398.009. Resulta interesante observar las diferencias de composici√≥n de las edades de las personas beneficiarias. Una particularidad que tuvo el programa a partir de su segunda edici√≥n es la ampliaci√≥n del beneficio para las personas afiliadas al PAMI, que recibieron un 70% de cr√©dito por sus compras de servicios tur√≠sticos. En este sentido, se evidencia un aumento de las personas beneficiarias de 60 a√±os y m√°s a partir de la segunda edici√≥n, pasando del 11% al 20%. La tercera edici√≥n muestra otro aumento en la participaci√≥n de este tramo de edad, alcanzando un 28% de participaci√≥n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl programa tuvo, por otra parte, una amplia distribuci√≥n territorial. Provincias como R√≠o Negro, Tierra del Fuego, Misiones o Mendoza estuvieron entre los destinos con mayor cantidad de viajes cargados y viajeros que los visitaron. R√≠o Negro fue la provincia con mayor cantidad de viajes cargados y con mayor cantidad de viajeros (96.675) en la primera edici√≥n, con Bariloche como su destino m√°s visitado. La provincia de Buenos Aires fue especialmente elegida en la segunda edici√≥n, cuando la Costa Atl√°ntica registr√≥ niveles de actividad muy elevados en t√©rminos hist√≥ricos (la cantidad de viajeros en esa edici√≥n lleg√≥ a 880.238). Tambi√©n fue la provincia m√°s elegida en la tercera edici√≥n, con 147.436 viajeros. La Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires aparece como el segundo destino m√°s visitado en la tercera edici√≥n (104.574 viajeros), caracterizada por viajes de menor duraci√≥n. Si se suman los viajes de las 3 ediciones, se alcanza un total de m√°s de 2 millones de viajes cargados y cerca de 6 millones de viajeros.4\n\n\n\nLa evoluci√≥n del gasto del cr√©dito permite ver, por otra parte, la evoluci√≥n del programa en toda su extensi√≥n.\nSi bien la magnitud de la segunda edici√≥n muestra la importancia de la temporada de verano en el gasto tur√≠stico, es posible destacar que existi√≥ una mayor participaci√≥n de los meses de menor peso hist√≥rico en la actividad. A modo de ejemplo, los datos muestran que en febrero de 2022 hubo mayor gasto que en enero de ese mismo a√±o. Las participaciones de octubre y noviembre, de la mano de la tercera edici√≥n, marcan el objetivo a futuro del programa: aumentar la participaci√≥n de los meses de menor demanda tur√≠stica para suavizar la estacionalidad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviaje en el contexto general\nComo fuera mencionado, existe un conjunto de recursos publicados en el SINTA que permite analizar el programa Previaje a la luz de la evoluci√≥n del turismo interno en los √∫ltimos a√±os.\n\n\n\nEl impacto de la pandemia fue especialmente severo en la actividad tur√≠stica: la actividad econ√≥mica en hoteles y restaurantes tuvo ca√≠das muy superiores al nivel general. Asimismo, la recuperaci√≥n del sector tuvo un vigor menos marcado, en un principio por las limitaciones que a√∫n impon√≠a la pandemia. Es por ello que la primera edici√≥n del programa procur√≥ garantizar la temporada tur√≠stica de 2021. En una segunda instancia, la recuperaci√≥n del sector estuvo liderada por el turismo interno, cuyo volumen hist√≥ricamente elevado durante la temporada de 2022 permiti√≥ acercar los niveles de actividad a los a√±os previos al COVID-19. Sin embargo, el nivel global de la actividad todav√≠a no hab√≠a alcanzado, hacia fines de 2022, los valores previos, debido a la m√°s lenta recuperaci√≥n del turismo internacional.\n\n\n\nA modo de ilustraci√≥n de la importancia del turismo interno en la recuperaci√≥n reciente, puede observarse que la actividad hotelera, medida por la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera, alcanz√≥ niveles r√©cord de pernoctaciones de viajeros residentes a lo largo de todos los meses de 2022.\nEncuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH)\nüìä Datos abiertos\nüìä Informes\nüìä Reporte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtro aspecto mencionado anteriormente es la marcada estacionalidad de la actividad tur√≠stica: algunos meses del a√±o (t√≠picamente los primeros meses del a√±o y julio) concentran una porci√≥n significativa de la actividad, lo que redunda en la inestabilidad del empleo y los ingresos de quienes trabajan en el sector. En este sentido, se observ√≥ durante 2022 una leve ca√≠da en la participaci√≥n de enero y m√°s notoriamente del mes de julio (en un contexto de crecimiento de esos meses respecto de los niveles previos a la pandemia). A su vez, febrero y abril mejoraron sustancialmente su peso en el total. Como puede observarse, persiste a√∫n una elevada disparidad entre la participaci√≥n de cada mes. En particular, los meses de mayo y junio son los de menor nivel de pernoctaciones. Es por ello que las pr√≥ximas ediciones de Previaje apuntar√°n a equilibrar estas asimetr√≠as que, al interior de algunos destinos, pueden ser a√∫n m√°s importantes.5\n\n\n\nRecursos disponibles\nLos datos abiertos de Previaje forman parte de un conjunto de recursos de turismo interno publicados en datos.yvera.gob.ar, que incluye turismo social, la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares y los datos que provienen del Certificado √önico Habilitante para Circulaci√≥n (CUHC) - Verano.\nüîó Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de Argentina (SINTA)\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\nPara m√°s detalles del programa visitar previaje.gob.ar.

Con ella se busc√≥ conocer las principales fortalezas y desaf√≠os que enfrentan los diferentes actores que componen la cadena de valor del sector, as√≠ como el impacto de la pandemia sobre la actividad y las nuevas tendencias esperadas por los prestadores.\nLa encuesta consisti√≥ en un formulario online, de respuesta an√≥nima y no obligatoria, dividido en cinco bloques. El primer bloque, general a todos los prestadores, busc√≥ relevar las caracter√≠sticas principales de los participantes. El segundo bloque se centr√≥ en preguntas espec√≠ficas para los rubros de alojamiento, agencias de viajes y transporte. En el tercer bloque se consult√≥ sobre el impacto de la pandemia en la actividad y acerca de la utilizaci√≥n de programas de auxilio del Estado y l√≠neas de financiamiento. El bloque cuatro estuvo destinado a conocer las principales limitaciones enfrentadas por los encuestados en los rubros y provincias o regiones en las que operan, y las soluciones potenciales para superar dichas restricciones. Por √∫ltimo, el quinto bloque ahond√≥ sobre las tendencias esperadas en el sector tur√≠stico en la pospandemia.\nEn total, la encuesta fue enviada por mail a 19.258 prestadores de servicios de alojamiento, agencias de viajes, transporte, gastronom√≠a, gu√≠as de turismo, entre otros, y respondida por 2.882.\nCaracter√≠sticas generales\nDe acuerdo con el relevamiento realizado, las cuatro grandes categor√≠as consideradas n√∫cleo (Agencias de viajes, Transporte, Alojamiento y Gastronom√≠a) representan el 70% del total de encuestados. El restante 30% se reparte entre otras actividades productoras de bienes y servicios complementarios y aquellos desarrollados en parques nacionales, playas, museos y parques tem√°ticos. Los gu√≠as de turismo y los prestadores dedicados a las excursiones representan una porci√≥n significativa de los encuestados, con un 12% y 10%, respectivamente.\n\n\n@import

respuestas.\n\n\n\nLa distribuci√≥n de la cantidad de empleados entre los distintos rubros es heterog√©nea. El rubro gastronom√≠a es el de menor participaci√≥n de prestadores sin empleados (29%), mientras que la venta de artesan√≠as y productos regionales cuenta con un 93% de prestadores sin empleados. De manera similar, los gu√≠as de turismo y servicios de excursiones tambi√©n presentan un alto porcentaje de prestadores sin empleados.\n\n\n\nImpacto de la pandemia\nDe acuerdo con el relevamiento realizado, se observan respuestas dispares en relaci√≥n a la variaci√≥n de la cantidad de trabajadores respecto de 2019. La opci√≥n que indica que no vari√≥ la dotaci√≥n de trabajadores, y aquella que muestra una ca√≠da mayor al 25% representan la mayor√≠a de las respuestas. Los rubros alojamiento, agencias de viajes, gastronom√≠a, transporte y venta de artesan√≠as tienen como respuesta m√°s frecuente el mantenimiento de la dotaci√≥n. En cambio, los servicios de gu√≠as de turismo y de excursiones muestran una ca√≠da superior al 25% como respuesta m√°s elegida.\n\n\n\nCon el fin de mitigar los efectos de la pandemia en este sector, el gobierno implement√≥ un paquete de medidas en el per√≠odo 2020-2021. En ese marco, el 85% de los encuestados se√±al√≥ haber recibido alg√∫n tipo de asistencia. Entre los principales programas utilizados por las empresas/trabajadores independientes, aparecen APTur, con 954 respuestas, PreViaje (666), REPRO 2 (625) y ATP (620).\n\n\n\nComplementariamente a los programas de asistencia, estuvieron vigentes distintas l√≠neas de cr√©dito orientadas a financiar capital de trabajo e inversiones. De acuerdo con la encuesta, el 33% de los consultados tuvo acceso a ellas. Los porcentajes m√°s elevados correspondieron a las categor√≠as gastronom√≠a (43,5%) y alojamiento (39%).\nLimitantes para el desarrollo y posibles soluciones\nFrente a la consulta sobre los limitantes al desarrollo del sector, se destaca la menci√≥n a la insuficiente infraestructura en el rubro alojamiento, gu√≠a de turismo y excursiones. Las dificultades de acceso al cr√©dito son relevantes en agencias de viajes, transporte y gastronom√≠a. Los problemas de conectividad fueron elegidos por prestadores de agencias de viaje y alojamiento. La falta de promoci√≥n tur√≠stica es se√±alada por gu√≠as de turismo, organizadores de excursiones y alojamientos. La dificultad de contrataci√≥n en puestos operativos es se√±alada en el rubro gastron√≥mico como limitante m√°s frecuente.\n\n\n\nAdicionalmente, se pregunt√≥ qu√© pol√≠ticas consideran los prestadores que podr√≠an ayudar a superar las limitaciones antes mencionadas. La opci√≥n por facilidades de financiamiento ocup√≥ un lugar destacado. La inversi√≥n en infraestructura complementaria para la puesta en valor de los destinos tur√≠sticos es una opci√≥n mencionada especialmente entre prestadores de alojamiento, gu√≠as de turismo, excursiones, transporte y venta de artesan√≠as. Los programas de promoci√≥n de los destinos, as√≠ como aquellos de consolidaci√≥n de la oferta y la generaci√≥n de nuevos productos, circuitos y rutas complementarias, fueron otras de las pol√≠ticas predominantes entre las elecciones de los prestadores.\nProspectiva\nLa pandemia ha modificado los comportamientos y gustos de los viajeros, con creciente inter√©s en lo natural, lo personalizado o en grupos reducidos y con cierta flexibilidad a posibles contingencias. De la encuesta, surge que la principal transformaci√≥n fue, previsiblemente, una mayor preferencia por el turismo dentro del pa√≠s. En este sentido, el inter√©s por el turismo de naturaleza muestra una participaci√≥n destacada. El aumento de las reservas de √∫ltimo momento y con posibilidades de cancelaci√≥n destacan entre las respuestas de los prestadores de agencias de viajes. La preferencia por destinos tur√≠sticos no masivos est√° presente tambi√©n en prestadores de excursiones, gastronom√≠a y transporte.\n\n\n\nLa gran mayor√≠a de los encuestados considera que estos cambios se mantendr√°n en los pr√≥ximos a√±os: todas las categor√≠as muestran valores cercanos al 80% respondiendo afirmativamente.\nHasta aqu√≠ se presentan los principales resultados. El informe incluye adem√°s un an√°lisis con mayor detalle de cada bloque de la encuesta y una secci√≥n especial para el bloque dos, que contiene preguntas espec√≠ficas para los rubros Alojamientos, Agencias de viaje y Transporte.\nEl documento forma parte de la serie de Documentos de Trabajo de la DNMyE, disponibles en https://biblioteca.yvera.tur.ar/.\nSe puede acceder al documento en el siguiente enlace\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\n\n\n",

Esta nueva versi√≥n incorpora novedades que permiten, por ejemplo, cuantificar y caracterizar a los viajes de los visitantes internacionales (sumando datos de excursionistas a los de turistas), o la caracterizaci√≥n de perfiles de turismo receptivo (no residentes que visitan Argentina).\n\n\n\nNOVEDADES\nRESUMEN\nLa primera pesta√±a presenta el contenido de toda la aplicaci√≥n, a la vez que permite visualizar r√°pidamente una serie de tiempo con las estimaciones de Emisivo y Receptivo, incorporando un men√∫ desplegable que permite explorar la serie por mercados (por pa√≠s de residencia o destino agrupado). Se agregaron adem√°s dos nuevas visualizaciones que muestran el acumulado anual al √∫ltimo dato disponible por mercado y por medio de transporte.\n\n\n\nEMISIVO / RECEPTIVO\nLas pesta√±as por tipo de turismo (emisivo o receptivo) de la versi√≥n previa permiten ahora no s√≥lo acceder a las estimaciones de los viajes de los turistas, que es el valor por defecto en ambas pesta√±as, sino tambi√©n a los viajes de los excursionistas (aquellos visitantes que no pernoctan en el destino). Una caja de selecci√≥n al comienzo de los respectivos m√≥dulos de FILTRO permite seleccionar la opci√≥n de preferencia.\nPor otro lado se gener√≥ la posibilidad de nuevas aperturas dentro de los m√≥dulos de VISUALIZACI√ìN. A las variables ya habilitadas (para Mostrar por los datos previamente filtrados), como ser Mes, V√≠a, Paso, etc., se agregaron Tipo de Visitante, G√©nero y Tramos de edad.\n\n\n\nPERFIL RECEPTIVO\nEsta nueva pesta√±a permite caracterizar el perfil del turismo receptivo que egres√≥ del pa√≠s por los pasos de Ezeiza y Aeroparque, a partir de la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI). Se pueden analizar algunas caracter√≠sticas de los turistas (pa√≠s de residencia, tipo de alojamiento principal en el pa√≠s, motivo de viaje), as√≠ como conocer los destinos (localidades, provincias) que han visitado en la Argentina y el gasto tur√≠stico -a nivel trimestral- que han realizado durante sus viajes en el pa√≠s.\nEncuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI)\nüìä Datos Abiertos\nüìö Metodolog√≠a\nüìë Reportes\n\nSe puede acceder a la plataforma desde la p√°gina del SINTA o directamente desde la p√°gina: https://tableros.yvera.tur.ar/turismo_internacional/\n\nPara recibir las novedades del SINTA escrib√≠le al bot de Telegram de la DNMyE SintIA: @RDatinaBot ü§ñ\n\n\n\n\n",

La misma est√° disponible en espa√±ol e ingl√©s y cuenta con m√°s de 80 documentos especializados con informaci√≥n complementaria.\nComo parte de esta propuesta, desde la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica (DNMyE), publicamos un visor de informaci√≥n geogr√°fica que implic√≥ un trabajo de georreferenciaci√≥n de informaci√≥n y el desarrollo de una herramienta interactiva, como parte de la Plataforma de Inversiones Tur√≠sticas, con el objetivo de facilitar el an√°lisis y la toma de decisiones sobre las oportunidades de negocios en el contexto de las jurisdicciones.\n\n\n\nHoja de Ruta por el Visor Geogr√°fico de Turismo para las Inversiones\nLa aplicaci√≥n permite explorar el conjunto de informaci√≥n disponible poniendo el foco en cada una de las provincias.\nPor defecto muestra dos tipos de referencias relativas a las Inversiones Tur√≠sticas: (a) Oportunidades de Inversi√≥n y (b) Territorios de Oportunidad.\nUna vez elegido un distrito se puede marcar una caja que permite visualizar Obras de Infraestructura Tur√≠stica en curso (diferenciando si las mismas ya se encuentran financiadas o proyectadas).\nLa herramienta presenta luego tres tipos de capas de informaci√≥n adicional que pueden ser activadas:\nCONECTIVIDAD: agrupa informaci√≥n relativa a las redes viales (nacional y provincial), aeropuertos, puertos y pasos internacionales.\nESTAD√çSTICAS: una selecci√≥n de indicadores de oferta y demanda del sector hotelero y acceso a internet de la poblaci√≥n.\nCAPAS GEOGR√ÅFICAS: permite visualizar pol√≠gonos de √°reas protegidas y la propuesta territorial del programa La Ruta Natural.\n\nüîó ACCESO AL MAPA https://tableros.yvera.tur.ar/inversiones/\nGlosario\nTerritorios de oportunidad: atractivos estrat√©gicos culturales o de naturaleza con potencial de desarrollo.\nVectores de inversi√≥n: actividades tur√≠sticas vinculadas al desarrollo tur√≠stico con potencial para invertir.\nOportunidades de negocio: terrenos y/o bienes p√∫blicos o privados disponibles para desarrollar diversas actividades que contribuyan a la mejora de la oferta tur√≠stica local y/o regional.\nFuentes de Informaci√≥n\nLa informaci√≥n de territorios de oportunidad y oportunidades de inversi√≥n, as√≠ como la informaci√≥n relativa a las obras de infraestructura fue elaborada por el Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes de la Naci√≥n.\nLos datos correspondientes a v√≠as terrestres provienen de las capas geogr√°ficas publicadas por el Instituto Geogr√°fico Nacional (IGN) y el Ministerio de Obras P√∫blicas de la Naci√≥n (MOP). La selecci√≥n de v√≠as terrestres principales fue realizada por el Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes.\nLos datos de pasos terrestres internacionales y de puertos principales fueron producidos a partir de las capas geogr√°ficas publicadas por el MOP e IGN, junto a un proceso de geocodificaci√≥n de los pasos internacionales reportados por la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones del Ministerio de Interior.\nLos datos de los aeropuertos provienen de informaci√≥n facilitada por la Administraci√≥n Nacional de Aviaci√≥n Civil.\nLos datos correspondientes a cantidad de plazas por departamento provienen del Padr√≥n √önico Nacional de Alojamiento (PUNA) de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica del Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes de la Naci√≥n (DNMyE).\nLos datos de demanda tur√≠stica fueron elaborados a partir de la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera realizada por la DNMyE junto al Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠sticas y Censos.\nLa informaci√≥n sobre acceso a internet proviene del cruce entre datos del Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones (ENACOM) y la poblaci√≥n proyectada por INDEC.\nLa capa geogr√°fica de √°reas protegidas proviene del IGN a partir de la cual la DNMyE ha realizado una selecci√≥n.\nLa capa geogr√°fica de rutas naturales fue elaborada por el Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes de la Naci√≥n.

En primera instancia, los datos, accesibles a trav√©s del portal, refieren a solicitudes y pernoctaciones de turistas que visitaron las Unidades Tur√≠sticas de Chapadmalal en Buenos Aires (UTC) y Embalse en C√≥rdoba (UTE).\nLos recursos publicados contienen informaci√≥n para el per√≠odo 2009-2021 con una frecuencia anual y, adem√°s de conocer la evoluci√≥n, permiten desagregar por provincia de origen de los turistas y por tipo de plan utilizado.\nDe esta manera, se puede ver, por ejemplo, la distribuci√≥n de pernoctaciones seg√∫n provincia de origen para el a√±o 2021:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSe observa que Buenos Aires y CABA encabezan el top 5 de lugares de origen de los turistas, concentrando el 91% para la UTC y el 79% para la UTE. Sin embargo, la proporci√≥n de pernoctes de bonaerenses es mayor en Chapdmalal, mientras que en Embalse hay una mayor participaci√≥n de turistas de CABA, seguidos por Buenos Aires y C√≥rdoba.\nPor otra parte, se puede desagregar por tipo de plan solicitado por los turistas. En este sentido, se ve que Eventos y Terciarios es el m√°s requerido, con una participaci√≥n del 67% para UTC y 58% para UTE, seguido del Plan Familiar.\n\n\n\nVisit√° nuestro portal de datos abiertos para conocer m√°s sobre los datos y realizar tus an√°lisis.\n\n\n\n",

Contiene un an√°lisis en base a datos de la ocupaci√≥n hotelera obtenidos de la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH) y una caracterizaci√≥n de la estacionalidad ampliada hacia la totalidad de los destinos del pa√≠s con datos de empleo registrado publicados por el Centro de Estudios para la Producci√≥n (CEP XXI). Adicionalmente, se estudia la estacionalidad en aquellos departamentos o partidos con relevancia en t√©rminos de empleo tur√≠stico y a nivel provincial para observar las particularidades de cada jurisdicci√≥n.\nLa estacionalidad de la demanda constituye una caracter√≠stica inherente del sector tur√≠stico. El comportamiento estacional, para el caso de Argentina, es marcado en los primeros meses del a√±o, con una recuperaci√≥n en julio, mes de las vacaciones de invierno. Sin embargo, este fen√≥meno no es homog√©neo entre destinos. Observando algunas de las 49 localidades relevadas por la EOH, puede verificarse que conviven destinos con actividad m√°s estable a lo largo del a√±o, como la Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires (CABA), localidades con picos en verano, como Villa Gesell; otros en la temporada invernal, como el caso de Salta en julio; y, por √∫ltimo, casos, como el de San Mart√≠n de los Andes, con 2 temporadas altas en un mismo a√±o.\n\n\n\nEstacionalidad en la ocupaci√≥n hotelera\nTomando como indicador de estacionalidad el porcentaje que representa el mes de mayor actividad ‚Äìen este caso las pernoctaciones en hoteles y parahoteles- respecto respecto del promedio del a√±o, se observa que destinos como Mar del Plata, Villa Gesell en la Costa Atl√°ntica, Bariloche en la Patagonia y Salta en el Norte, tienen un mes donde las pernoctaciones superan en un 50% al promedio del a√±o. En cambio, CABA muestra, en su mes de mayor actividad, menos de un 25% respecto de la media anual. En t√©rminos generales, las capitales de las provincias muestran una estacionalidad baja o media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstacionalidad en el empleo\nPara tener una caracterizaci√≥n de la estacionalidad de la totalidad de los destinos del pa√≠s, se tomaron los datos abiertos de empleo registrado por departamento/partido y sector de actividad, publicados por el Centro de Estudios para la Producci√≥n (CEP XXI) de la Secretar√≠a de Industria y Desarrollo Productivo de la Naci√≥n, en base a informaci√≥n del Sistema Integrado Previsional Argentino (SIPA).\nUna mirada a nivel nacional permite ver que, m√°s all√° de la tendencia decreciente desde 2018 y la recuperaci√≥n de los √∫ltimos meses, se observa especialmente la estacionalidad en el empleo en Servicios de Alojamiento, con el nivel creciendo hasta alcanzar un m√°ximo en el mes de enero y luego reduci√©ndose hasta un m√≠nimo en junio. Sucede lo mismo con la gastronom√≠a, si bien solo una parte de su producci√≥n es consumida por visitantes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomando los departamentos o partidos con relevancia en t√©rminos de empleo tur√≠stico (aquellos que tienen 250 o m√°s puestos o bien aquellos que representan el 5% o m√°s del empleo en alojamiento de la provincia), podemos ver que los partidos de la costa bonaerense tienen una fuerte estacionalidad, al igual que C√≥rdoba y el departamento de R√≠o Hondo, en Santiago del Estero. En La Costa, el empleo de enero fue un 107% mayor al de la media del a√±o.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaracterizaci√≥n provincial\nLa caracterizaci√≥n de la estacionalidad, medida como el porcentaje del empleo registrado en un mes con respecto al promedio del a√±o, puede realizarse tambi√©n a nivel provincial, para observar las particularidades de cada una de ellas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomando el mes con mayor cantidad de puestos de trabajo y su desv√≠o respecto de la media, es posible observar que la mayor√≠a de las provincias tienen su pico en enero, febrero y diciembre. C√≥rdoba, por ejemplo, tuvo un 20,5% m√°s de empleo en enero con respecto al promedio del a√±o. Mendoza es el ejemplo opuesto: el mes con mayor empleo (febrero) es solamente un 1,7% m√°s que el promedio del a√±o.\n\n\n@import

    "contents": "\nEn un primer post presentamos a SintIA, el bot de Telegram la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica (DNMyE) que env√≠a avisos sobre novedades a usuarios y usuarias del SINTA.\nEn esta instancia, compartimos otra funcionalidad que incorporamos al flujo interno de trabajo de la direcci√≥n. Habitualmente, utilizamos datos publicados por otros organismos, como el INDEC o el Ministerio de Desarrollo Productivo, para el an√°lisis y la elaboraci√≥n de estad√≠sticas referentes al sector tur√≠stico del pa√≠s.\nPor ejemplo, el √çndice de Precios al Consumidor (IPC), la cantidad de puestos de trabajo por sector o el Estimador Mensual de Actividad Econ√≥mica (EMAE), son insumos √∫tiles en la caracterizaci√≥n del turismo como actividad econ√≥mica.\nEn este sentido, hacer seguimiento de las novedades en esos recursos resulta importante para la actualizaci√≥n de los datos publicados en el SINTA. Para evitar realizar consultas, cotidianas, de forma manual, optamos por asignarle la tarea a SintIA.\n¬øQu√© hace SintIA?\nA trav√©s de un flujo automatizado con Github Actions, SintIA revisa todos los d√≠as, en distintos horarios, si se actualiz√≥ alguno de los recursos utilizados por la direcci√≥n. Para esto, lee los datos publicados en los portales correspondientes, mediante su URL, y los compara con los √∫ltimos datos registrados (los cu√°les se encuentran guardados en un csv).\nEn caso de que haya nuevos datos, guarda los cambios en el csv y env√≠a un mensaje por Telegram al equipo de la DNMyE, como el siguiente:\n\n\n\n(¬°S√≠, con meme incluido!)\nCada recurso tiene un ID, un nombre, un link y un emoji asignados, para facilitar tanto la consulta como el aviso al equipo. De esta forma, no tenemos que preocuparnos por visitar los portales de datos cotidianamente, ya que SintIA lo hace program√°ticamente.\n¬øQuer√©s crear tu propio bot?\nDesde la DNMyE abrimos el c√≥digo utilizado para programar este flujo, pod√©s conocer m√°s sobre su funcionamiento en el siguiente repositorio de Github: https://github.com/dnme-minturdep/sintIA_consultas.\nAdem√°s, usando el c√≥digo de base pod√©s armar tu propio bot para recibir avisos de recursos que te sean √∫tiles en tus proyectos. Te compartimos unos pasos a seguir para hacerlo:\nHac√© un fork del repositorio en tu Github.\nCre√° un bot en Telegram a trav√©s de la aplicaci√≥n. Interactuando con el usuario @BotFather pod√©s generar el token que te permitir√° enviar y recibir mensajes, adem√°s de ponerle un nombre y una descripci√≥n.\nUsando el paquete de R telegram.bot (ver documentaci√≥n) pod√©s buscar el ID de la persona o las personas a notificar (las cuales deben inicializar o escribirle al bot primero).\nGuard√° las claves (token e IDs) en lugares que no sean visibles por cualquiera, en nuestro caso usamos Github Secrets, y hac√© los cambios necesarios en el c√≥digo para recibir actualizaciones de tu inter√©s.\n¬°Esperamos te sea de utilidad!\nY no te olvides de ponerte en contacto con SintIA para recibir las novedades del SINTA, buscando al usuario de Telegram @RDatinaBot o siguiendo este link: https://t.me/RDatinaBot.\n\n\n\n",

A su vez, tambi√©n el INDEC public√≥ la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (MINTURDEP-INDEC) con datos de septiembre y del tercer trimestre del a√±o para los pasos relevados (Ezeiza, Aerop. J. Newbery, Aerop. de C√≥rdoba, Aerop. de Mendoza, Cristo Redentor y Puerto de Buenos Aires)\nNovedades\nHasta ahora en el informe de prensa de la ETI se publicaban los datos del turismo internacional correspondientes a los pasos fronterizos relevados por la encuesta y el movimiento del total de la v√≠a a√©rea. Nosotros, por otro lado, publicamos los datos del total pa√≠s por todas las v√≠as. Esto muchas veces generaba confusiones o malas interpretaciones entre ambos n√∫meros publicados. Por ello, se decidi√≥ incluir los datos del total nacional en el informe de prensa de la ETI y as√≠ mejorar la interpretaci√≥n de la informaci√≥n comunicada.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Estimaci√≥n de Turismo Internacional por todas las v√≠as, septiembre 2022\n\n\n\nEncuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI) - Septiembre 2022\nüìù Informe\nEsta decisi√≥n es el resultado del compromiso de trabajo conjunto con el equipo de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Estad√≠sticas del Sector Externo y Cuentas Internacionales del INDEC, con quienes elaboramos todos los meses los datos de turismo internacional y realizamos la encuesta de turismo. Creemos que, de esta manera, la difusi√≥n de la informaci√≥n del turismo receptivo y emisivo de nuestro pa√≠s ser√° m√°s clara y permitir√° un mejor an√°lisis de su evoluci√≥n.\nAlgunos puntos que vale la pena destacar:\n(1) en los informes hemos renombrado la unidad de an√°lisis que contabilizamos todos los meses. En pos de definir mejor la terminolog√≠a utilizada, seg√∫n las definiciones internacionales de turismo, lo que antes llam√°bamos ‚Äúturistas‚Äù, ahora lo renombramos como ‚Äúviajes de turistas‚Äù tanto para el turismo receptivo como el emisivo. Por su parte, ahora la ETI distingue los viajes (de turistas o excursionistas) de los visitantes en tanto personas (turistas o excursionistas).\nPara que se entienda la diferencia r√°pidamente nos valemos del siguiente ejemplo:\n\nsi un espa√±ol viene a la argentina, visita Uruguay por unos d√≠as y luego vuelve y sigue recorriendo nuestro pa√≠s, seg√∫n las recomendaciones internacionales, se deben contabilizar dos viajes (el transcurrido desde que llega a la Argentina hasta que se va a Uruguay y luego cuando vuelve de all√≠ y sale definitivamente del pa√≠s) y un visitante.\n\nUn mismo visitante puede realizar m√°s de un viaje tur√≠stico. Ambas unidades de an√°lisis (viajes y visitantes) ser√°n contabilizadas y comunicadas en el informe de prensa de la ETI a partir de la publicaci√≥n del d√≠a de hoy.\n(2) Datos 2022: han sido rectificados debido a una mejor operacionalizaci√≥n de los criterios utilizados, pero se mantiene la misma metodolog√≠a de estimaci√≥n.\n(3) Metodolog√≠a: este trabajo conjunto con INDEC para estimar el turismo internacional se basa en los registros migratorios brindados por la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones del Ministerio del Interior. Esta fuente de datos y la metodolog√≠a dise√±ada fueron claves, por ejemplo, en √©pocas de restricciones por la pandemia del Covid19, cuando las encuestas de turismo internacional se suspendieron y no se contaba con informaci√≥n suficiente para realizar las estimaciones de turismo de nuestro pa√≠s. Con ese impulso se comenz√≥ a trabajar con los datos de registros migratorios de forma m√°s exhaustiva, posibilitando la publicaci√≥n de los datos del turismo en nuestro pa√≠s.\nEs a partir de esta experiencia que hoy podemos calcular el flujo de viajes y visitantes (turistas y excursionistas) para todo el pa√≠s en el informe de la ETI. M√°s all√° de su publicaci√≥n mensual, esta metodolog√≠a funciona como instrumento de uso interno muy relevante para hacer un seguimiento de la evoluci√≥n del turismo internacional con una mayor frecuencia a la publicada.\nToda esta informaci√≥n est√° disponible en las distintas secciones del Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stico de la Argentina (SINTA):\n‚Ä¢ Tablero de turismo internacional:\nhttps://tableros.yvera.tur.ar/turismo_internacional/\n‚Ä¢ Informes de prensa:\nhttps://www.yvera.tur.ar/sinta/informe/info/turismo-internacional\n‚Ä¢ Reportes:\nhttps://tableros.yvera.tur.ar/internacional.html\n\n\n\n",

El tablero acerca una nueva fuente de datos para el estudio de una dimensi√≥n clave de la actividad tur√≠stica que se suma al Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de la Argentina (SINTA) donde ya est√°n disponibles PUNA, Turismo Internacional, Agencias de Viaje y mapeAR.\n\n\n\n\n\nLos datos utilizados provienen del Sistema Integrado de Aviaci√≥n Civil (SIAC) y son facilitados por la ANAC. La DNMYE realiza un ulterior procesamiento de los mismos para reducir el universo de an√°lisis a aquellos movimientos a√©reos relevantes para la actividad tur√≠stica. Es por eso que del total de movimientos registrados por el SIAC s√≥lo se presenta la informaci√≥n correspondiente a movimientos de las principales l√≠neas aerocomerciales, excluyendo los movimientos de vuelos charter, trabajos a√©reos, instrucci√≥n, vuelos oficiales y vuelos privados.\nAdem√°s del proceso de limpieza y selecci√≥n de los registros relevantes para las estad√≠sticas del turismo, para el caso de los movimientos de vuelos internacionales tambi√©n se realiza un entrecruzamiento de datos con los registros de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones del Ministerio de Interior de la Naci√≥n a los fines de establecer un perfil de nacionalidades de las rutas aerocomerciales. Para ello se utiliza informaci√≥n anonimizada y agregada a nivel mensual de los pasajeros de vuelos internacionales seg√∫n n√∫mero de vuelo.\nDe esta manera se facilita el estudio sobre qu√© l√≠neas y rutas a√©reas resultan potencialmente m√°s relevantes para los diferentes mercados del turismo receptivo y del turismo emisivo, aunque cabe aclarar que esto es s√≥lo un indicador proxy de dicho fen√≥meno.\n\nEl tablero interactivo presenta informaci√≥n clave de la actividad aerocomercial en cuatro pesta√±as:\nResumen: presenta el mapa interactivo de las rutas a√©reas y la serie de tiempo del volumen de pasajeros y asientos\nConectividad: a partir de datos ANAC presenta la tabla din√°mica con los datos de movimientos a√©reos, vuelos, pasajeros, pasajeros promedio, asientos y asientos promedio con los mayores niveles de desagregaci√≥n posible a la fecha.\nPasajeros Internacionales: a partir del cruce de datos ANAC y DNM presenta la informaci√≥n correspondiente a la cantidad de pasajeros seg√∫n nacionalidad, ruta a√©rea y aerol√≠nea para diferentes periodos de tiempo. 1\nPuentes A√©reos: a partir del cruce de datos ANAC y DNM presenta como tabla din√°mica los principales indicadores para cada par ciudad de origen y ciudad de destino final como cantidad de pasajeros de nacionalidad argentina y de otras nacionalidades, cantidad de asientos, participaci√≥n de los asientos de la empresa sobre el total de asientos del puente, y peso relativo de los pasajeros sobre los asientos (en porcentajes).\nUna pesta√±a adicional, Metodolog√≠a aclara cuestiones conceptuales sobre el tratamiento de los datos y definici√≥n de las variables. Adem√°s se posibilita la descarga de todas tablas para que las personas interesadas puedan generar sus propios procesamientos.\nPueden encontrar el tablero aqu√≠: https://tableros.yvera.tur.ar/conectividad/\nTambi√©n pueden consultar los reportes mensuales realizados por la ANAC en su sitio web: https://datos.anac.gob.ar/estadisticas/.\nUna aclaraci√≥n al respecto de como aparecen los pares origen - destino en esta pesta√±a: en la tabla din√°mica aparecen siempre aeropuertos argentinos como aeropuerto de destino porque el procedimiento de entrecruzamiento procura mostrar desde qu√© ciudades retornan hacia Argentina las personas con nacionalidad argentina y desde qu√© ciudades vienen hacia Argentina las personas sin nacionalidad argentina.\n\n‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",

As√≠, desde el Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de la Argentina (SINTA) se puede encontrar, por ejemplo, un Portal de Datos Abiertos de Turismo o una serie de Tableros y Reportes interactivos, entre otros.\nConscientes de que la informaci√≥n es mucha, as√≠ como los formatos y tecnolog√≠as necesarios para acceder a ellos son diversos, seguimos dando pasos para ordenar ese caudal de datos, procurando hacer m√°s amigable y previsible nuestra comunicaci√≥n. Un paso en este sentido lo dimos con la generaci√≥n de un Calendario de Publicaciones en el marco del SINTA, con el objetivo de ofrecer una espacio que pudiera consolidar buena parte de la producci√≥n que realiza el equipo.\nPara la primera versi√≥n de SintIA (a√∫n en modo de prueba y desarrollo) pensamos un recurso extra en este sentido. B√°sicamente, la idea que ac√° presentamos es automatizar avisos de las novedades publicadas en el Calendario, de modo que las usuarias y usuarios que hacen contacto con SintIA reciben esta informaci√≥n como notificaciones sin necesidad de acceder cada d√≠a a revisar en el portal si se publicaron nuevos recursos. Los contenidos que all√≠ se publican anuncian son:\nInformes t√©cnicos\nActualizaciones de tableros y reportes\nCarga de recursos al Portal de datos abiertos\nNuevas publicaciones de la Bit√°cora\nOtras noticias\nTelegram bot\nSintIA es un bot de la plataforma de mensajer√≠a Telegram. Basicamente se trata de una secuencia de pasos que una computadora realiza a partir de instrucciones (programadas con el lenguaje de programaci√≥n R, a trav√©s de la liber√≠a telegram.bot).\nEl lenguaje R permite automatizar los procesos de consulta al calendario para revisar si existen nuevas publicaciones en el d√≠a y, de ser as√≠, indicarle a SintIA que le avise a las usuarias y los usuarios que quieran recibir las notificaciones.\nMientras que la libreria telegram.bot se utiliza para interactuar con la API (Application Programming Interface) de Telegram, con el fin de facilitar la creaci√≥n y administraci√≥n de bots a trav√©s R.\nAdem√°s, el flujo de consultas al calendario y env√≠o de notificaciones de SintIA se encuentra automatizado usando Github Actions. De esta forma el bot tiene cierta ‚Äúautonom√≠a‚Äù para ejecutarse y enviar avisos, sin la necesidad de un trabajo manual.\nPor el momento SintIA est√° programada para enviar mensajes cuando hay novedades en el calendario, es decir, que no es es posible interactuar como chatbot (hacerle preguntas, por ejemplo). Esperamos a futuro poder darle m√°s funcionalidades en ese sentido.\n¬øC√≥mo recibir avisos de SintIA?\nInstalar o abrir la aplicaci√≥n Telegram (o escanear el c√≥digo QR de abajo)\nBuscar el usuario @RDatinaBot\nHacer click en INICIAR para registrarse\n¬°Listo! Cuando haya alguna novedad en el calendario, SintIA te enviar√° un mensaje de aviso\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

De acuerdo con el Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Clim√°tico (IPCC), se espera que, en las pr√≥ximas d√©cadas, el incremento de la temperatura media mundial por encima de los 1,5¬∫C con respecto a los niveles preindustriales, lleve al aumento en la periodicidad e intensidad de los fen√≥menos clim√°ticos extremos, acarreando grandes consecuencias para toda la sociedad y, particularmente, para los sectores m√°s vulnerables de la misma.\nEn este marco y en funci√≥n del principio 3 de la Ley Nacional de Turismo 25.997, el cual consagra al desarrollo sustentable como una de las gu√≠as rectoras para el fomento, el desarrollo, la promoci√≥n y la regulaci√≥n de la actividad tur√≠stica, el Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes de la Naci√≥n (MINTURyDEP), a trav√©s de la Subsecretar√≠a de Calidad, Accesibilidad y Sustentabilidad del Turismo Nacional y la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Calidad e Innovaci√≥n Tur√≠stica, implementa el programa de Directrices de Gesti√≥n Ambiental (DGA) perteneciente al Sistema Argentino de Calidad Tur√≠stica (SACT).\nLas DGA tienen por objetivo garantizar la calidad ambiental, social y cultural de las organizaciones tur√≠sticas a trav√©s de la difusi√≥n de un conjunto de recomendaciones capaces de guiar a dichas entidades hacia el establecimiento de un sistema de gesti√≥n ambiental, que contribuya a la calidad de servicio, solucione y aten√∫e los impactos producidos y minimice los costos de gesti√≥n y adaptaci√≥n. En este sentido, la implementaci√≥n de estas directrices en una localidad apunta a producir un impacto global y busca instalar una gesti√≥n ambiental integrada del destino, involucrando a los sectores p√∫blico y privado, en la medida de que ello sea posible.\nHasta el momento, 395 DGA fueron otorgadas a diversas organizaciones del pa√≠s desde el a√±o 2013. Actualmente, el rubro con el mayor n√∫mero de organizaciones distinguidas por este subprograma es el de alojamientos, con 202 casos, el 51% del total.\n\n\n\nDe aquellas 202 organizaciones pertenecientes al rubro de alojamientos, la mayor√≠a son hoteles (72) y caba√±as (43). Juntas, ambas categor√≠as hacen al 29% del total de las organizaciones distinguidas por el subprograma.\n\n\n\nCon respecto a la distibuci√≥n espacial de las organizaciones distinguidas por mencionado subprograma, la mayor√≠a se ubica en la Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires (62) y, en un escal√≥n por debajo, en las provincias de Misiones (48), Jujuy (40) y Chubut (40). Sin embargo, siete provincias argentinas todav√≠a no cuentan con organizaciones distinguidas y cinco lo hacen con menos de 10.\n\n\n\nAl hacer foco en las ciuades del pa√≠s, la Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires es la urbe con el mayor n√∫mero de organizaciones distinguidas con las Directrices de Gesti√≥n Ambiental, con 62 casos. Luego, el podio lo completan las ciudades de Mar del Plata (Buenos Aires), Salta (Salta) y San Carlos de Bariloche (R√≠o Negro) con 19 cada una.\n\n\n@import

La apertura de estos datos constituye una pol√≠tica que promueve la transparencia en la gesti√≥n p√∫blica, a la vez que genera valor agregado para terceros1.\nEl valor de abrir datos p√∫blicos reside en que deben ser:\nF√°ciles de encontrar\nAccesibles para distintos tipos de usuarios y herramientas\n√ötiles para el an√°lisis (comparables, interoperables con otros datos, etc.)\nF√°ciles de integrar a sistemas, aplicaciones y otros desarrollos\nPortal de datos abiertos de turismo\nEn el 2020, la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica (DNMyE) del Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes inaugur√≥ el portal de datos vinculados a la actividad tur√≠stica del pa√≠s, siguiendo los lineamientos y est√°ndares de datos abiertos.\nPod√©s acceder al Portal dentro del Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de la Argentina (SINTA).\nAl d√≠a de la fecha, el portal cuenta con un total de:\n11 conjuntos de datos o datasets\n114 recursos publicados o distribuciones, con frecuencias mensuales, trimestrales y anuales\nM√°s de 1260 series de tiempo, accesibles por medio de la API de Series de Tiempo de la Rep√∫blica Argentina\n770 usuarios mensuales que consultan datos del portal desde distintas partes de la Argentina y el mundo\nEl portal est√° basado en la tecnolog√≠a de Andino desarrollada por el equipo de Datos Argentina con el fin de facilitar la ditribuci√≥n de datos de organismos pertenecientes a la APN. Andino se construye a su vez sobre CKAN, un sistema de gesti√≥n de datos de c√≥digo abierto.\n¬øDatasets? ¬øDistribuciones? ¬øSeries de tiempo?\nLa DNMyE trabaja con numerosas fuentes de informaci√≥n que permiten analizar la actividad tur√≠stica de manera integral. Para organizar el contenido que se comparte, el portal se encuentra estructurado de acuerdo a temas dentro del turismo.\n\n\n\nEn la p√°gina de inicio del sitio se pueden visualizar los seis grupos o temas en los que se organizan los datos actualmente. Dentro de cada grupo, podemos encontrar uno o m√°s datasets.\nUn dataset es un agrupamiento de recursos de datos, permite la organizaci√≥n de archivos y la documentaci√≥n de los metadatos de la informaci√≥n.\nA su vez, dentro de cada dataset podemos encontrar los recursos o distribuciones. Estos constituyen la unidad de informaci√≥n m√°s peque√±a y son la pieza fundamental del portal ya que contienen los datos a consumir por el usuario.\nAs√≠, podemos acceder al grupo Sector hotelero dentro del cual nos encontramos con dos datasets: uno de la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH) y otro del Padr√≥n √önico Nacional de Alojamiento tur√≠stico de la Argentina (PUNA). Cada uno de estos datasets contiene un conjunto de recursos o distribuciones relacionados, por ejemplo, dentro de EOH encontramos archivos en formato CSV (separados por coma) con la cantidad de viajeros hospedados hoteles y parahoteles seg√∫n tipo de residencia, pernoctes, estad√≠a media, etc.\nA continuaci√≥n te presentamos una interfaz interactiva para navegar por el cat√°logo2 del portal, desagregando cada grupo en datasets, y cada dataset en distribuciones.\n\n\nShow code\n\ncatalogo <- readxl::read_excel(\"catalog.xlsx\")\n\n\ncollapsibleTree::collapsibleTree(catalogo,\n                                 colnames(catalogo), \n                                 linkLength = 200, #nodeSize = \"leafCount\",\n                                 root = \"TURISMO\",\n                                 fontSize = 10)\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"data\":{\"name\":\"TURISMO\",\"children\":[{\"name\":\"TURISMO INTERNACIONAL\",\"children\":[{\"name\":\"Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI)\",\"children\":[{\"name\":\"Turistas no residentes, pernoctaciones y estad√≠a media mensual en Ezeiza y Aeroparque\"},{\"name\":\"Turistas no residentes, pernoctaciones y estad√≠a media trimestral en Ezeiza y Aeroparque\"},{\"name\":\"Turistas no residentes, pernoctaciones y estad√≠a media trimestral en el Aeropuerto Internacional de C√≥rdoba\"},{\"name\":\"Turistas no residentes, pernoctaciones y estad√≠a media trimestral en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Mendoza\"},{\"name\":\"Turistas no residentes, pernoctaciones y estad√≠a media trimestral en el Puerto de Buenos Aires\"},{\"name\":\"Turistas no residentes, pernoctaciones y estad√≠a media trimestral en el Paso Internacional Cristo Redentor\"},{\"name\":\"Turistas no residentes seg√∫n principal motivo de viaje, por paso y trimestre\"},{\"name\":\"Turistas no residentes seg√∫n principal tipo de alojamiento, paso y trimestre\"},{\"name\":\"Gasto total, gasto por turista no residente y gasto promedio diario, en USD, por paso y trimestre\"},{\"name\":\"Ficha T√©cnica: ETI\"},{\"name\":\"Serie de tiempo -

Las series de tiempo son accesibles a trav√©s de la API3 para su consulta r√°pida y gr√°fica, entrando a la pesta√±a de Series.\nTEMAS\nSECTOR HOTELERO\nENCUESTA DE OCUPACI√ìN HOTELERA (EOH)\nLa EOH es un relevamiento realizado en forma continua desde el 2004, bajo la coordinaci√≥n del MINTURDEP y el Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠sticas y Censos (INDEC), que tiene como objetivo medir el impacto del turismo interno e internacional sobre la actividad de los establecimientos hoteleros y para-hoteleros.\nDentro del dataset de la EOH, van a encontrar recursos que ofrecen informaci√≥n de viajeros hospedados, pernoctaciones, estad√≠as promedio, tasas de ocupaci√≥n (en plazas y habitaciones), facturaci√≥n, ingresos (por habitaci√≥n disponible y ocupada) y puestos de trabajo. Esta informaci√≥n se ofrece desagregada por regi√≥n de destino (o localidad) y categor√≠a del establecimiento; y por residencia, en el caso de los recursos relacionados con viajeros hospedados, pernoctaciones y estad√≠as promedio.\nEl dataset de la EOH actualiza sus recursos de manera mensual, en el mismo momento en que se publica el informe t√©cnico del relevamiento en el portal de SINTA; existiendo una distancia de (aproximadamente) dos meses entre la publicaci√≥n y el relevamiento de los datos (por ejemplo, el 21 de junio de 2022 se publicaron los datos correspondientes al mes de mayo de 2022).\nPADR√ìN √öNICO NACIONAL DE ALOJAMIENTO (PUNA)\nEl PUNA lista todos los establecimientos de alojamiento tur√≠stico de la Argentina, a partir de las siguientes fuentes de informaci√≥n: organismos provinciales y municipales de turismo que elaboran el padr√≥n de alojamiento de su provincia o localidad; el INDEC a trav√©s de la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera y fuentes secundarias especializadas en turismo relevadas desde la DNMYE.\nEn este dataset se encuentran recursos con informaci√≥n de la cantidad de plazas, habitaciones y establecimientos tur√≠sticos por provincia, categor√≠a y cadena hotelera. Tambi√©n se encuentra disponible una base agrupada con datos por ruta natural, regi√≥n, provincia, localidad, clasificaci√≥n y tipo de establecimiento. Toda la informaci√≥n refiere al a√±o 2020, √∫ltima actualizaci√≥n del PUNA.\nTURISMO INTERNACIONAL\nTURISMO INTERNACIONAL - TOTAL PA√çS\nLos datos que se ofrecen en este dataset se producen en base a la informaci√≥n de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones y de la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (INDEC-Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes) y comprenden todos los pasos de ingreso/egreso al/del pa√≠s.\nEl dataset incluye un recurso de turismo receptivo, desagregado por pa√≠s o regi√≥n de origen de los turistas, seg√∫n v√≠a de ingreso al pa√≠s (a√©rea, terrestre o fluvial/mar√≠timo); mismo recurso para el turismo emisivo, desagregado por pa√≠s o regi√≥n de destino, seg√∫n v√≠a de egreso del pa√≠s; y un recurso donde se calcula el saldo de turistas, desagregado por pa√≠s o regi√≥n y v√≠a de ingreso/egreso.\nLa informaci√≥n se actualiza de manera mensual, en el mismo momento en el que se postea el informe de Turismo Internacional.\nENCUESTA DE TURISMO INTERNACIONAL (ETI)\nLa ETI es un operativo de encuesta continuo desde el a√±o 2004 realizado conjuntamente el INDEC y el MINTURDEP. Refiere a estad√≠sticas de turismo internacional de Argentina en los siguientes pasos relevados: Aerop. Int. de Ezeiza, Aeroparque J. Newbery, Aerop. Int. de C√≥rdoba, Aerop. Int. de Mendoza, Puerto de Bs. As. y en el paso terrestre Cristo Redentor. Se cuenta con informaci√≥n de turistas residentes y no residentes, pernoctes, gasto, tipo de alojamiento, motivo del viaje, entre otras variables.\nLos recursos del dataset ofrecen datos tanto del turismo internacional emisivo como del receptivo, incluyendo informaci√≥n de turistas, pernoctaciones, estad√≠a media y gasto (en USD), con desagregaci√≥n por paso, origen/destino de los turistas, motivo de viaje y principal tipo de alojamiento utilizado en el destino.\nMenci√≥n aparte merecen los recursos de turistas no residentes que visitan nuestro pa√≠s, ingresados por los pasos Ezeiza/Aeroparque, que aportan informaci√≥n desagregada por provincia visitada y por tipo de recorrido del viaje (se diferencia a los que visitaron solo la provincia de destino, los que visitaron dicha provincia y otra provincia, y los que no visitaron la provincia). En estos recursos se agrega la variable ‚Äúcasos_muestrales‚Äù, que debe ser tenida en cuenta a la hora de analizar la informaci√≥n ofrecida (se recomienda no sacar conclusiones en base a muestras poco robustas).\nPor motivos de dise√±o muestral, tanto la desagregaci√≥n a nivel temporal de los recursos como la actualizaci√≥n de la informaci√≥n dependen de tres factores: el paso de ingreso o egreso al/del pa√≠s; el tipo de informaci√≥n presentada; y el nivel de desagregaci√≥n de la misma.\nLos recursos que se actualizan de manera mensual (a la par de la publicaci√≥n del Informe de Turismo Internacional) son los que presentan informaci√≥n de turistas, pernoctes y estad√≠as promedio, desagregadas por origen/destino de los turistas, para los pasos Ezeiza/Aeroparque. El recurso que ofrece misma informaci√≥n de turistas no residentes, desagregada por provincia de destino y recorrido de viaje, tambi√©n se actualiza mensualmente. El resto de los recursos se actualizan trimestralmente, junto con la publicaci√≥n de datos del mes que cierra un trimestre (marzo, junio, septiembre, diciembre).\nAl igual que en el caso de la EOH, existe una distancia aproximada de dos meses entre el momento de relevar la informaci√≥n y la publicaci√≥n de la misma.\nTURISMO INTERNO\nENCUESTA DE VIAJES Y TURISMO DE LOS HOGARES (EVyTH)\nLa EVyTH tiene como objetivo medir la evoluci√≥n de los viajes realizados por los hogares argentinos, sus caracter√≠sticas y computar aspectos socio-demogr√°ficos que permitan caracterizar a los turistas residentes.\nPod√©s conocer m√°s sobre este operativo con informaci√≥n trimestral visitando los posts de nuestra Bit√°cora.\nExisten dos conjuntos de datos sobre EVyTH.\nBase de microdatos de la EVyTH: contiene los datos surgidos de las encuestas a nivel de hogares, permitiendo realizar procesamientos que excedan a la informaci√≥n ya publicada en informes, reportes y otros recursos del portal. Tambi√©n se cuenta con el respectivo dise√±o de registro, con el cual se pueden identificar el nombre de las variables (columnas), las categor√≠as de respuesta y sus respectivas etiquetas. La base tiene datos del a√±o 2012 hasta la √∫ltima actualizaci√≥n y se encuentra en dsitintos formatos (.csv, .txt, etc.)\nRecursos de la EVyTH: cuenta con estad√≠sticas de turistas residentes por regi√≥n de destino, regi√≥n de origen, edad, sexo, quintil de ingresos, tipo de transporte, tipo de alojamiento y pernoctaciones.\nCERTIFICADO √öNICO HABILITANTE PARA CIRCULACI√ìN (CUCH) - VERANO\nSe dispone informaci√≥n de los certificados de circulaci√≥n emitidos para ir de vacaciones durante la emergencia sanitaria. Presenta datos de cantidad de certificados totales emitidos y cantidad de personas que lo solicitaron por fecha de ingreso (d√≠a), provincia de origen y destino, desde el 01 de diciembre de 2020 al 01 de marzo de 2021.\nTURISMO NATURALEZA\nPARQUES NACIONALES\nSe cuenta con un dataset de estad√≠sticas de parques nacionales cuya fuente es el Registro Nacional de Autorizaciones, Recaudaciones e Infracciones (RENARI) de la Administraci√≥n de Parques Nacionales. Los datos refieren al total de visitas registrados en 35 parques nacionales seg√∫n tipo de residencia del visitante (residente o no residente) y regi√≥n de destino a nivel mensual.\nCALIDAD TUR√çSTICA\nSe recopila informaci√≥n del Sistema Argentino de Calidad Tur√≠stica (SACT), un conjunto de herramientas especialmente dise√±adas para promover la calidad bajo est√°ndares de sustentabilidad social, econ√≥mica, cultural y ambiental en cada una de las prestaciones tur√≠sticas que brindan los destinos de Argentina.\nEn este dataset se puede analizar la cantidad de organizaciones tur√≠sticas distinguidas y/o certificadas por el SACT, con identificaci√≥n de rubro, subrubro, ubicaci√≥n geogr√°fica, programa y subprograma al cual se adhirieron, fecha de distinci√≥n y/o certificaci√≥n.\nINVERSIONES TUR√çSTICAS\nAqu√≠ se presentan datos del Programa Nacional de Inversiones Tur√≠sticas (PNIT) respecto de los fondos deseignados para inversiones de inter√©s tur√≠stico. El objetivo de este programa es fortalecer los destinos y productos tur√≠sticos con vistas a la captaci√≥n y radicaci√≥n de inversiones privadas, posibilitando generar m√°s empleo y desarrollo socio-econ√≥mico territorial.\nEl recurso de este tema permite conocer el listado de proyectos tur√≠sticos con identificaci√≥n de a√±o de firma de convenio, provincia, departamento y municipio en el que se ejecut√≥.\nPara conocer las fechas de publicaci√≥n de los informes mencionados/actualizaci√≥n de datasets, pod√©s acceder al calendario de la DNMyE.\n¬øC√ìMO HACER USO DE DATOS ABIERTOS?\nAl abrir datos permitimos la libre descarga, distribuci√≥n, transformaci√≥n, exhibici√≥n y representaci√≥n de los mismos, con la correspondiente cita a la DNMyE, a cualquier usuario para que incluya en sus propios proyectos e investigaciones.\nVeamos un ejemplo de uso de datos abiertos con el lenguaje de programaci√≥n R y el software Rstudio. Partiendo del recurso de Visitas a los Parques Nacionales por regi√≥n de destino seg√∫n tipo de residencia del visitante en base a datos de la Administraci√≥n de Parques Nacionales, generaremos un gr√°fico para visualizar la evoluci√≥n en la cantidad de visitas a Parques Nacionales por residencia. Luego haremos otro breve an√°lisis de la proporci√≥n de residentes y no residentes por regi√≥n.\n1. Leyendo los datos\nEmpezamos por traer los datos a nuestro espacio de trabajo. Para esto tenemos dos opciones:\nA. Descargar el recurso del portal en nuestro dispositivo y cargarlo en el programa de nuestra preferencia.\nB. Utilizar la URL del recurso para levantar los datos sin necesidad de descargar el archivo.\nOptaremos por la segunda opci√≥n, usando la funci√≥n read.csv() para leer archivos separados por coma.\nAs√≠ luce nuestra base de datos:\n\n\nShow code\n\ndatos_pn <- read.csv(\"http://datos.yvera.gob.ar/dataset/458bcbe1-855c-4bc3-a1c9-cd4e84fedbbc/resource/e8f7c0d7-02f9-4fdd-aa83-d61c13f565ae/download/visitas-residentes-y-no-residentes-por-region.csv\")\n\nhead(datos_pn, 5)\n\n\n  indice_tiempo region_de_destino origen_visitantes visitas\n1    2008-01-01      buenos aires     no residentes       0\n2    2008-01-01      buenos aires        residentes     885\n3    2008-01-01      buenos aires             total     885\n4    2008-01-01           cordoba     no residentes     145\n5    2008-01-01           cordoba        residentes     717\n  observaciones\n1              \n2              \n3              \n4              \n5              \n\n2. Transformaci√≥n de datos\nEl recurso viene con una pre-limpieza y una estructura sencilla para poder trabajarlo, sin embargo vamos a hacer unas peque√±as transformaciones antes de armar las visualizaciones.\nPara el gr√°fico de evoluci√≥n quitamos la fila con los subtotales regionales, ya que agruparemos por mes y residencia para comparar la cantidad de visitas por cada categor√≠a (residentes y no residentes). Adem√°s filtramos los datos a partir del 2018 para acortar el volumen de datos a graficar y pasamos la columna indice_tiempo a formato fecha.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) #Cargo librer√≠a\n\n#Creo tabla\nevolucion_pn <- datos_pn %>% \n  filter(origen_visitantes != \"total\", #Filtro datos\n         indice_tiempo >= \"2018-01-01\") %>% \n  group_by(indice_tiempo, origen_visitantes) %>% \n  summarise(visitas = sum(visitas, na.rm = T)) %>% #Calculo visitas por mes y origen\n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(indice_tiempo = as.Date(indice_tiempo)) #Transformo columna a formato fecha\n\n\n\nAhora nuestra tabla se ve as√≠:\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 3\n  indice_tiempo origen_visitantes visitas\n  <date>        <chr>               <int>\n1 2018-01-01    no residentes      167987\n2 2018-01-01    residentes         514310\n3 2018-02-01    no residentes      142845\n4 2018-02-01    residentes         373521\n5 2018-03-01    no residentes      121394\n\nPara nuestro gr√°fico por regi√≥n, filtramos los datos de diciembre 2019 para contar con informaci√≥n representativa del flujo de visitas ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (ya que a partir de marzo 2020 el turismo se vio afectado por la pandemia). Luego pasamos la columna que contiene los nombres de las regiones a may√∫sculas y agregamos la tilde en ‚ÄúCordoba‚Äù.\nFinalmente, calculamos la proporci√≥n por residencia para cada regi√≥n de destino.\n\n\nregiones_pn <- datos_pn %>% \n  filter(origen_visitantes != \"total\", #Filtro datos\n         indice_tiempo == \"2019-12-01\") %>% \n  mutate(region_de_destino = str_to_title(region_de_destino), #Ajusto nombres de regiones\n         region_de_destino = ifelse(region_de_destino == \"Cordoba\",\n                                    \"C√≥rdoba\", region_de_destino)) %>% \n  group_by(region_de_destino) %>% \n  mutate(proporcion = visitas/sum(visitas)) %>% #Calculo proporci√≥n de visitas por regi√≥n\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\nNuestra tabla queda as√≠:\n\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 6\n  indice_tiempo region_de_destino origen_vis‚Ä¶¬π visitas obser‚Ä¶¬≤ propo‚Ä¶¬≥\n  <chr>         <chr>             <chr>          <int> <chr>     <dbl>\n1 2019-12-01    Buenos Aires      no resident‚Ä¶      10 \"\"      0.00835\n2 2019-12-01    Buenos Aires      residentes      1188 \"\"      0.992  \n3 2019-12-01    C√≥rdoba           no resident‚Ä¶     195 \"\"      0.159  \n4 2019-12-01    C√≥rdoba           residentes      1032 \"\"      0.841  \n5 2019-12-01    Cuyo              no resident‚Ä¶     237 \"\"      0.132  \n# ‚Ä¶ with abbreviated variable names ¬π‚Äãorigen_visitantes,\n#   ¬≤‚Äãobservaciones, ¬≥‚Äãproporcion\n\n3. Visualizaciones\nUsando el paquete ggplot2 vamos a armar nuestros gr√°ficos.\nPara la evoluci√≥n elegimos un gr√°fico de l√≠neas y trazamos una l√≠nea con un color distinto para cada categor√≠a de origen, de manera de distinguir residentes de no residentes.\n\n\nShow code\n\noptions(scipen = 99) #Cantidad m√°xima de d√≠gitos que se muestran en los gr√°ficos\n\n# Armo gr√°fico de evoluci√≥n\nevolucion_pn %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(indice_tiempo, visitas, #Capa con l√≠neas por categor√≠a\n                 color = origen_visitantes)) +\n  geom_point(aes(indice_tiempo, visitas, color = origen_visitantes)) + #Capa con puntos por categor√≠a\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"residentes\" = \"red\", \n                               \"no residentes\" = \"blue\")) + #Asigno colores a cada categoria\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"3 month\", #Configuro etiquetas del eje X como fecha\n               date_labels = \"%b%y\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45), #Personalizo el theme\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        title = element_text(size = 10),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 7)) +\n  labs(title = \"Evoluci√≥n mensual de las visitas a Parques Nacionales seg√∫n origen\", #Defino etiquetas de t√≠tulo, ejes y fuente\n       x=\"\", y = \"Visitas\", color = \"Visitantes\",\n       caption = \"Fuente: Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica, Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes, en base a datos suministrados \\npor la Direcci√≥n de Mercadeo de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Uso P√∫blico de la Administraci√≥n de Parques Nacionales.\")\n\n\n\n\nNota: al ver el gr√°fico se evidencia la falta de visitantes durante el 2020 por causa de la pandemia. Si bien esta informaci√≥n es conocida, desde la DNMyE incorporamos una columna de observaciones en los recursos para hacer este tipo de aclaraciones en caso de eventos extraordinarios que impactan en los datos.\nAhora nos interesa saber si existen regiones con mayor proporci√≥n de visitantes residentes o no residentes, en otras palabras, conocer si las regiones reciben m√°s turismo interno o internacional. Para esto hacemos un gr√°fico de barras apiladas de acuerdo a los porcentajes que representa cada categor√≠a al interior de la regi√≥n, algo que calculamos anteriormente.\n\n\nShow code\n\n#Armo gr√°fico por regi√≥n\nregiones_pn %>% \n   ggplot(aes(fill=origen_visitantes, y=proporcion, x=region_de_destino)) + \n    geom_col(position=\"fill\") + #Gr√°fico de columnas\n    geom_text(aes(x = region_de_destino, y = proporcion, \n                  label = paste0(round(proporcion*100,1), \" %\"), group = origen_visitantes),\n              position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) + #Agrego etiquetas con porcentajes\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0,1)) + #Ajusto eje Y como porcentaje\n    theme_minimal() + #Personalizo theme\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n             title = element_text(size = 10),\n          plot.caption = element_text(size = 7)\n    ) + #Agrego etiquetas\n    labs(title = \"Participaci√≥n de las visitas en Parques Nacionales seg√∫n origen\",\n         subtitle = \"en porcentaje, diciembre 2019\",\n         x=\"\",y=\"\",\n         caption = \"Fuente: Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica, Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes, en base a datos suministrados \\npor la Direcci√≥n de Mercadeo de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Uso P√∫blico de la Administraci√≥n de Parques Nacionales.\")\n\n\n\n\nEste gr√°fico nos permite ver r√°pidamente que las regiones Litoral y Patagonia son las que reciben m√°s visitas de no residentes en Parques Nacionales.\nYa tenemos nuestras visualizaciones sobre visitas a parques nacionales. ¬°Anim√°te a hacer la tuya!\n\nConoc√© m√°s sobre datos abiertos y el acceso a la informaci√≥n p√∫blica visitando: https://www.argentina.gob.ar/aaip/accesoinformacion/datospublicos‚Ü©Ô∏é\nEl cat√°logo recopila y ordena todos los metadatos del conjunto de datos abiertos de una organizaci√≥n.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nUna Application Programming Interface (API) es una interfaz de programaci√≥n de aplicaciones que permite la consulta program√°tica y personalizada de datos.‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",

    "contents": "\n\nSeg√∫n los datos del Registro de Agencias de Viajes de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Agencias de Viajes al 15 de marzo de 2022 hab√≠a registradas 5.150 en todo el pa√≠s. En base a la informaci√≥n declarada por estas agencias se caracteriza el sector en relaci√≥n a su distribuci√≥n geogr√°fica y el tipo de turismo con el que operan.\n\nTIPO DE TURISMO\nLas agencias de viajes y turismo pueden operar con turismo interno, turismo internacional, o ambas. De las 5150 agencias el 88,54%, es decir 4.560 agencias, opera con turismo internacional, ya sea receptivo y/o emisivo. Mientras que 3.035 agencias declararon operar con turismo interno, representando un 58,9% del universo considerado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl analizar el tipo de turismo internacional, se puede ver que un 69,5% declara comercializar solo turismo emisivo, mientras que un 18,3% realiza tanto operaciones de turismo receptivo como de turismo emisivo, y un 12,2% opera turismo receptivo exclusivamente.\n\n\n\nSi bien en el agregado nacional hay un predominio de la actividad en torno al turismo emisivo, existen diferencias a nivel subnacional, tanto en relaci√≥n a la cantidad de agencias como a su distribuci√≥n seg√∫n el tipo de turismo con el que operan.\nGEOGRAF√çA DEL SECTOR\n\n\n\nDe las 5.150 agencias que se registran en el pa√≠s, la mayor parte se concentra en la Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires y en la provincia de Buenos Aires. En tercer y cuarto lugar seg√∫n la cantidad de agencias registradas se ubican las provincias de C√≥rdoba y Santa Fe. En conjunto estas cuatro provincias explican el 66,95% del total del pa√≠s.\n\n\n\nAdem√°s de la concentraci√≥n territorial descripta, se observa un comportamiento heterog√©neo en cuanto al tipo de turismo operado por las agencias seg√∫n provincia. El mapa a continuaci√≥n representa la cantidad de agencias de viaje por provincia y la proporci√≥n de las mismas que realiza servicios de turismo interno.\n\n\n\nSe puede apreciar que la proporci√≥n de agencias que realiza turismo interno no se distribuye de forma an√°loga a la cantidad de agencias a lo largo de pa√≠s. En el grupo de provincias con mayor peso de servicios de turismo interno, adem√°s de aparecer Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires y Santa Fe, que suman 2.835 agencias, tambi√©n se encuentran las provincias de Jujuy, La Pampa y Entre R√≠os, provincias con menos de 100 agencias cada una. Por otra parte, provincias con una elevada cantidad de agencias como Mendoza y Salta se hallan entre las que tienen una menor proporci√≥n de agencias que realizan operaciones de turismo interno.\nSi reproducimos el an√°lisis anterior para los diferentes tipos de operaciones con turismo internacional podemos distinguir el peso del turismo receptivo y el turismo emisivo en el sector de agencias de viaje para cada provincia.\n\n\n\nAs√≠, por una parte se puede ver que las cinco provincias con mayor peso del turismo emisivo representan 2.378 agencias, con Buenos Aires, Santa Fe y C√≥rdoba en el top tres seg√∫n proporci√≥n del turismo emisivo. Mientras que por otra parte las cinco provincias con mayor peso del turismo receptivo suman 572 agencias, con Salta, Catamarca y Tierra del Fuego entre las tres primeras.\nMERCADOS\n\n\n\nPara un subconjunto de las agencias que realiza turismo receptivo (656 agencias) se puede analizar con qu√© mercados declararon trabajar. Para esta muestra de agencias la regi√≥n con mayor participaci√≥n es Europa, con la cual opera el 65,4% de las agencias de la muestra, en segundo lugar le sigue Brasil operada por el 63,6% de las mismas. Por su lado, China es el mercado que cuenta con menor presencia, un 29,7% de las agencias declar√≥ operar con √©l.\n\n\n\nAl analizar la distribuci√≥n de agencias por cantidad de mercados que operan, se destaca que en mayor medida trabajan con una √∫nica regi√≥n o con todas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoniendo foco en el grupo de agencias que opera un solo mercado se encuentra que el 50,6% indic√≥ ‚ÄúResto del mundo‚Äù como √∫nica regi√≥n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTURISMO ESTUDIANTIL\n\n\n\nUno de los segmentos especializados es el de turismo estudiantil, el cual contabilizaba al 15 de marzo de 2022 un total de 225 agencias (4,4% del total de agencias habilitadas). En relaci√≥n al tipo de viaje ofrecido, un 79,6% organiza o comercializa viajes de estudios, mientras que un 65,8% distribuye viajes de egresados.\n\n\n\nRespecto del destino, un 96,4% realiza viajes en el pa√≠s y un 17,3% en el exterior. El principal destino nacional seleccionado por el segmento estudiantil es Carlos Paz, al cual viajan el 60% de las agencias, seguido de Bariloche (35,6%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLERO INTERACTIVO DE AGENCIAS\nA partir de los datos del Registro de Agencias de Viajes de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Agencias de Viajes la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠sticas hace p√∫blico para la consulta de los datos aqu√≠ presentados el Tablero de Agencias de Viaje.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

En esta oportunidad, se publica para el p√∫blico general el √∫ltimo Informe Mensual de Estad√≠sticas de Turismo (IMET), correspondiente al mes de julio.\n\n\nA continuaci√≥n se enumeran los contenidos que actualmente forman parte del informe, junto con la fuente de donde provienen los datos\nContenidos\nTurismo Internacional\nEn base a la estimaci√≥n del turismo internacional elaborada por la DNMyE, con datos de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones y la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI), se expone, en primer lugar, la evoluci√≥n del turismo receptivo, el emisivo y la balanza tur√≠stica.\nLuego se refleja la evoluci√≥n del gasto tur√≠stico internacional en base a la informaci√≥n proveniente de la Cuenta Viajes y la Cuenta Pasajes de la Balanza de Pagos del INDEC. Cabe destacar que dicho indicador est√° compuesto por el gasto de los visitantes (turistas + excursionistas) y las compras de pasajes internacionales por parte de personas no residentes de Argentina a empresas residentes, en el caso del turismo receptivo, y por parte de personas residentes de Argentina a empresas no residentes, para el caso del turismo emisivo.\nEn tercer lugar, se presentan los mercados de origen y destino de los turistas, junto al saldo (receptivo-emisivo) de los principales destinos.\nEn cuarto lugar, la evoluci√≥n del √çndice de tipo de cambio real multilateral tur√≠stico, que refleja la competitividad cambiaria de Argentina, teniendo en cuenta la participaci√≥n del resto de los pa√≠ses en el flujo tur√≠stico del pa√≠s. Se contempla, tambi√©n, la existencia de tipos de cambios diferentes al oficial que puedan influir en las transacciones de los turistas.\nPor √∫ltimo, se muestra informaci√≥n referida a la conectividad a√©ra internacional, a trav√©s de la cantidad de pasajeros transportados, asientos ofrecidos y vuelos realizados. Todo ello, en base a datos de la Administraci√≥n Nacional de Aviaci√≥n Civil (ANAC).\n\n\nTurismo interno\nSe presenta informaci√≥n relevante de la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH). En particular, la cantidad de turistas internos provenientes de grandes aglomerados urbanos, la estad√≠a media y el gasto, con frecuencia trimestral. Tambi√©n podr√° encontrase informaci√≥n sobre actividad aerocomercial de cabotaje, tales como asientos ofrecidos y pasajeros transportados, tomando datos de la ANAC\n\n\n\nSector hotelero\nIncluye estad√≠sticas relevadas por la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH). Podr√°n visualizarse datos referidos a las pernoctaciones, los viajeros hospedados y su estad√≠a promedio, seg√∫n su residencia de origen (residentes y no residentes).\n\n\nEconom√≠a del sector tur√≠stico\nEl Estimador Mensual de Actividad Econ√≥mica (EMAE), elaborado por el INDEC, permite ver la evoluci√≥n de la actividad econ√≥mica por sector de actividad, con frecuencia mensual. Se destaca, entonces, el seguimiento de la actividad en hoteles y restaurantes, en relaci√≥n con el nivel general y el resto de los sectores.\nPor otra parte, se podr√° encontrar informaci√≥n referida al empleo privado registrado en todos los rubros econ√≥micos, distingui√©ndose el de hoteles y restaurantes. Esta informaci√≥n es elaborada en base a datos del Ministerio de Trabajo (MTEySS) a partir del Sistema Integrado Previsional Argentino (SIPA).\n\n\n\n\nTurismo en el mundo\nEvoluci√≥n de las llegadas de turistas internacionales por regi√≥n y subregi√≥n de destino, con √©nfasis en Sudam√©rica, en base a datos del Bar√≥metro de la Organizaci√≥n Mundial del Turismo (OMT)\n\n\n\nPerfil del turista no residente\nA partir de informaci√≥n de la ETI, se presentan las caracter√≠sticas de los turistas no residentes (g√©nero, edad), y sus viajes (tipo de alojamiento elegido, utilizaci√≥n de paquete tur√≠stico, motivo de viaje), correspondientes al √∫ltimo trimestre disponible. A su vez, se exponen las actividades realizadas y la calificaci√≥n de calidad que le otorgan los turistas a los rubros utilizados.\n\nPerfil del turista interno\nTomando los datos relevados por la EVyTH, se presentan las caracter√≠sticas de los turistas internos (distribuci√≥n por quintil de ingresos, edad, regi√≥n de origen y g√©nero), as√≠ como las caracter√≠sticas de sus viajes (medio de transporte utilizado, motivo de viaje, regi√≥n de destino, tipo de alojamiento elegido), para el √∫ltimo trimestre relevado.\n\nJULIO 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nContents\nPaquete {comunicacion}\nFunciones\n\nPaquete {herramientas}\n\nA lo largo del √∫ltimo a√±o y medio, la DNMyE se ha puesto como objetivo mejorar los productos ya existentes, desarrollar nuevos y avanzar en la sistematizaci√≥n y automatizaci√≥n de los flujos de trabajo que hacen posible lo mencionado anteriormente. Un primer gran resultado que hemos alcanzado con este proyecto es la creaci√≥n del Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de la Argentina (SINTA).\nEn paralelo, esta oficina estad√≠stica se ha propuesto avanzar en la transparencia y apertura tanto de los datos que produce como de los procesos que se llevan adelante para la generaci√≥n de informaci√≥n. En este camino hemos decidido incorporar como herramienta de trabajo para el procesamiento de datos (y m√°s) al lenguaje de programaci√≥n estad√≠stica R1 y la plataforma Rstudio2. Esto nos permiti√≥, por un lado, disponer del basto conjunto de librer√≠as disponibles tanto para el procesamiento de datos en general como para todo aquello que lo rodea (validaci√≥n y visualizaci√≥n de la informaci√≥n, dise√±o de plataformas para la presentaci√≥n de los productos, organizaci√≥n de flujos de trabajo, entre otros).\nPor otro lado, una de las potencialidades de los esquemas del software de c√≥digo abierto con licencia libre es la capacidad que tienen las personas, institutos, empresas y tambi√©n diferentes organismos del Estado para contribuir en el desarrollo de herramientas, sea tanto para uso interno como externo. Es en este sentido que desde la DNMyE avanzamos en la creaci√≥n de dos librer√≠as en R que nos faciliten el d√≠a a d√≠a en dos aspectos esenciales para la Direcci√≥n: el procesamiento de datos y la comunicaci√≥n de la informaci√≥n.\n\nPaquete {comunicacion}\n\n\n\n{comunicacion} ofrece un set de funciones que facilitan la visualizaci√≥n y presentaci√≥n de la informaci√≥n estad√≠stica en la DNMyE, basados en el conjunto de lineamientos del Manual de marca institucional de Presidencia de la Naci√≥n Argentina, sea para logotipos, paletas de colores o piezas de comunicaci√≥n.\nFunciones\nCon crear_informes() ponemos a disposici√≥n un esqueleto de la estructura de nuestros informes. La idea es que los y las t√©cnicas de la DNMyE no tengan que preocuparse por configuraci√≥nes de formato, est√©tica y se puedan enfocar, principalmente, en el procesamiento y an√°lisis de la informaci√≥n.\n\n\n\nCon scale_fill_dnmye() podemos alinear el conjunto de visualizaciones que producimos con los lineamientos del manual de estilo. Por ejemplo:\n\n\n\nAdem√°s, creamos funciones para setear de forma manual los colores institucionales, como dnmye_colores() y otras para, por ejemplo, generar el c√≥digo necesario que permita agrupar m√∫ltiples fragmentos de Rmarkdown en pesta√±as, como rmdautotabs() 3.\n\nRepositorio en Github\n\n\nDocumentaci√≥n de la librer√≠a\n\n\nPaquete {herramientas}\n\n\n\nEl objetivo del paquete es proveer a la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠sticas de un set de funciones para el procesamiento de datos. Entre las principales se pueden encontrar:\nremover_tildes(): Funci√≥n que elimina tildes de las vocales y la letra ‚Äúy‚Äù:\n\n\nherramientas::remover_tildes(\"Un√° or√°ci√≥n ll√©n√° de t√≠ldes\")\n\n\n[1] \"Una oracion llena de tildes\"\n\n\nnumeros_en_palabras(): Funci√≥n que transforma d√≠gitos del 0 al 100 en palabras:\n\n\nherramientas::numeros_en_palabras(c(1, 01, 54, \"25 de mayo\"))\n\n\n[1] \"uno\"                 \"uno\"                 \"cincuenta y cuatro\" \n[4] \"veinticinco de mayo\"\n\n\nlimpiar_texto(): Funci√≥n que aplica limpieza general del texto:\n\n\nherramientas::limpiar_texto(\"T√©xt√≥ lleno de t√≠ld√©s m√°l puest√°s y e√±es por todos √±ados\")\n\n\n[1] \"texto lleno de tildes mal puestas y enes por todos nados\"\n\n\nOtras funciones:\n%out%: Valores no contenidos dentro de un conjunto.\ntasa_variacion(): Calcula la tasa de variaci√≥n con respecto al per√≠odo previo seg√∫n se defina.\nset_user_srv(): Gu√≠a para la configuraci√≥n de las credenciales en .Renviron\narchivo_plano_srv() Devuelve las l√≠neas de una archivo plano en el server, es para usar junto a read.csv() y otras funciones de lectura de archivos plano.\nread_rds_srv() y read_sav_srv(): Leen especificamente esos tipo de archivos mediante gzcon() y getBinaryURL()\nwrite_file_srv: Hace una conexi√≥n a la ruta indicada dentro del servidor de la DNMyE y escribe un archivo .csv, .rds, .txt o .sav\n\nRepositorio en Github\n\n\nDocumentaci√≥n de la librer√≠a\n\nPara facilitar el acceso a estas funciones a diferentes usuarios por fuera de la DNMyE, hemos abierto el repositorio desde el cual desarrollamos la librer√≠a y, tambi√©n, hemos puesto a disposici√≥n la documentaci√≥n correspondiente para entender y aplicar estas herramientas. Tambi√©n abrimos un espacio para que, quien lo desee, pueda contribuir con aportes al desarrollo de los paquetes. Para ello recomendamos leer la documentaci√≥n del repositorio y la gu√≠a para contribuir\nCon este camino recorrido, la DNMyE se ha propuesto avanzar en el desarrollo de herramientas para facilitar y mejorar el procesamiento de datos y, al mismo tiempo, continuar con la apertura de datos y procesos.\n\nR Core Team (2022).

Por ejemplo, los aeropuertos internacionales del pa√≠s, los principales destinos tur√≠sticos de una provincia o las Rutas Naturales en las que se divide al territorio argentino ocupan un lugar en el espacio.\nAl contar con este tipo de datos se pueden elaborar mapas para visualizar la informaci√≥n geogr√°fica, algo √∫til para conocer la distribuci√≥n de esos datos en el espacio y como soporte para la elaboraci√≥n de estrategias de desarrollo y promoci√≥n tur√≠stica.\nPor esto, desde la DNMyE se propuso desarrollar una plataforma de acceso libre para la realizaci√≥n de mapas de Argentina, con el objetivo de facilitar el proceso a qui√©nes no cuentan con conocimientos en herramientas de dise√±o o programaci√≥n. Se puede acceder a la misma en el siguiente link: https://tableros.yvera.tur.ar/mapeAr/\nTrabajando con informaci√≥n geogr√°fica\nExisten distintos tipos de datos espaciales que se pueden ‚Äúmapear‚Äù, los cuales se representan a trav√©s de geometr√≠as:\nPuntos: refieren a una latitud y longitud espec√≠fica donde se ubica el dato. Por ejemplo, el Puerto de Buenos Aires o las Cataratas del Iguaz√∫.\nL√≠neas: podemos definirlas como una sucesi√≥n de puntos. Un claro ejemplo son las rutas nacionales y provinciales.\nPol√≠gonos: representan √°reas en el espacio, es decir, que tienen l√≠mites. Las provincias de un pa√≠s se representan con pol√≠gonos, as√≠ como el pa√≠s en s√≠ mismo, por mencionar unos ejemplos.\nEstos datos se suelen almacenar en distintos formatos, pero hay algunos espec√≠ficos para guardar informaci√≥n geogr√°fica como .geojson y .kml, especialmente cuando se trabaja con l√≠neas y pol√≠gonos. En el caso de puntos, es com√∫n utilizar formatos m√°s conocidos como .xlsx y .csv, donde tenemos una columna con la latitud del dato y otra con la longitud. A continuaci√≥n podemos ver un ejemplo de una tabla muy sencilla, que contiene algunos aeropuertos del pa√≠s:\n\n\nlatitud\n\n\nlongitud\n\n\nnombre_aeropuerto\n\n\n-31.323601\n\n\n-64.208000\n\n\nIng.

Cuando abrimos la aplicaci√≥n nos encontramos con la siguiente interfaz:\n\n\n\nDel lado izquierdo se encuentran los controles para poder cargar y personalizar las capas de datos geogr√°ficos, mientras que a la derecha podemos previsualizar el mapa. Al iniciarse, se muestra una capa base con la geometr√≠a de Argentina con la divisi√≥n provincial, sobre la cual podemos realizar distintos ajustes y agregar m√°s capas.\nPara entender mejor el funcionamiento de la aplicaci√≥n, hagamos un ejemplo de un mapa que muestre los aeropuertos que vimos m√°s arriba, y para agregar un poco m√°s de informaci√≥n, incorporemos las rutas nacionales.\nCapa base\nEmpecemos por configurar la capa base. Para nuestro ejemplo, vamos a dejar como base todo el pa√≠s, pero si quisi√©ramos enfocarnos en algunas provincias podr√≠amos seleccionarlas desde Filtrar provincias. Luego vamos a darle un poco de dise√±o a nuestra capa base cambiando el color de Relleno a ‚Äú#D4D4D4‚Äù1, el cual representa un gris claro, y el color de las L√≠neas a ‚ÄúBlanco‚Äù.\nPara no complejizar la visualizaci√≥n, dejaremos el resto de las opciones de la capa base tal cual vienen cargadas. Sent√≠te libre de utilizar los botones de agregar las geometr√≠as del continente y los departamentos o los nombres de las provincias, para darle m√°s contexto al mapa.\nYa tenemos nuestro mapa base de Argentina, ahora incorporemos m√°s informaci√≥n.\nCapas predefinidas\nEn la DNMyE utilizamos algunas capas vinculadas a la actividad tur√≠stica cotidianamente, por lo cual resulta √∫til poder cargar las mismas de manera r√°pida. Para esto, en el bloque de capas predefinidas guardamos las siguientes geometr√≠as, con algunos par√°metros preestablecidos (como el color): Regiones, Rutas Naturales, Circuitos (tur√≠sticos), √Åreas Protegidas, V√≠as Nacionales y Capitales.\nEn nuestro ejemplo vamos a agregar la capa de V√≠as Nacionales, por lo que la elegimos en el primer selector de Opciones de capa, esperamos a que cargue y dejamos el segundo selector con la opci√≥n ‚ÄúNinguna‚Äù. Ahora tenemos un mont√≥n de l√≠neas sobre el mapa, que nos permiten visualizar c√≥mo se conecta el pa√≠s a trav√©s de las rutas nacionales. Como luego vamos a incorporar nuestros datos de aeropuertos, ajustemos la Opacidad de las l√≠neas para que sea m√°s f√°cil visualizar y distinguir las distintas capas. Arrastramos el control hasta el valor 0.6.\nHasta el momento nuestro tablero y mapa luce de la siguiente manera:\n\n\n\nCapas personalizadas\n¬°Lleg√≥ la hora de cargar nuestros propios datos! En este caso, vamos a sumar la base de aeropuertos que mencionamos, la cual contiene √∫nicamente tres columnas (latitud, longitud y nombre del aeropuerto) y se encuentra en formato .xlsx.\nAntes de cargar un archivo, es importante saber que hay algunos requisitos y recomendaciones que seguir para que la plataforma levante nuestra base de manera correcta. En la secci√≥n ¬øC√≥mo usar? se puede encontrar una descripci√≥n detallada, sugerimos leerla y descargar la base modelo con algunos aeropuertos (que es una versi√≥n m√°s completa de la que estamos utilizando para el ejemplo).\nEn la secci√≥n de Capa 1 nos encontramos con los siguientes comandos:\n\n\n\nPrimero, marcamos la opci√≥n de geometr√≠a que vamos a mapear. Para el ejemplo elegimos la opci√≥n de Puntos, ya que estamos trabajando con aeropuertos que tienen unas coordenadas (latitud y longitud) definidas. Luego hacemos click en ‚ÄúBuscar‚Äù dentro de Cargar archivo y elegimos el archivo excel.\nSi todo anduvo bien, veremos que en nuestro mapa figuran algunos puntos. Empecemos por aumentar el tama√±o para identificarlos mejor, cambiando la opci√≥n Tama√±o a 5. Ya tenemos un mapa que cumple con nuestro objetivo de mostrar la ubicaci√≥n de los aeropuertos con las rutas de fondo, pero vamos a personalizar un poco m√°s la est√©tica final.\nCambiamos el Color de nuestros puntos a ‚Äú#821F1F‚Äù y la Forma a ‚ÄúTriangulos‚Äù, ahora podemos distinguirlos mejor. Tambi√©n queremos saber c√≥mo se llaman as√≠ que vamos a agregar unas etiquetas de Referencias, cambiando la opci√≥n de ‚ÄúNinguna‚Äù al nombre de nuestra variable ‚Äúnombre_aeropuerto‚Äù, el Tipo a ‚ÄúEtiqueta‚Äù y el Tama√±o a 3.\nSi la visualizaci√≥n nos convence podemos descargar nuetro mapa, para lo cual elegimos el formato de salida (por ejemplo, PNG) y configuramos los par√°metros de Ancho, Alto y DPI (resoluci√≥n de la imagen). En nuestro ejemplo dejaremos todo tal cual, resultando en el siguiente mapa:\n\n\n\n¬°Listo! Con algunos clicks y ajustes logramos armar un mapa para descargar, compartir o incluir en nuestros trabajos, partiendo de una base de datos propia. Si te da curiosidad saber qu√© es lo que sucede por detr√°s de mapeAr, pod√©s consultar el c√≥digo fuente en el repositorio de Github de la DNMyE. Tambi√©n compartimos el c√≥digo en R que permite replicar el mismo mapa que hicimos en la plataforma:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(geoAr)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n#Cargo base de aeropuertos\naeropuertos <- read_excel(\"aeropuertos_modelo.xlsx\") %>% \n  mutate(latitud = as.numeric(latitud),\n         longitud = as.numeric(longitud))\n\n#Cargo base de mapa Argentina\nmapa_argentina <- get_geo(\"ARGENTINA\", level = \"provincia\")\n\n#Cargo base de rutas nacionales del IGN\nrutas_nacionales <- read_sf(\"vial_nacional.kml\") %>% \n  group_by(rtn) %>% \n  summarise(geometry = st_combine(geometry)) %>% \n  ungroup()\n\n#Armo mapa\nmapa_ejemplo <- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = mapa_argentina, fill = \"#D4D4D4\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_sf(data = rutas_nacionales, color = \"#356296\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_point(data = aeropuertos, aes(x = longitud, y = latitud),color = \"#821F1F\", size = 5, shape = 17) +\n  geom_label_repel(data = aeropuertos, \n                   aes(x = longitud, y = latitud, label = nombre_aeropuerto), \n             size =3,  box.padding = 0.2, min.segment.length = 1,) +\n  theme_void()\nLa ventaja de mapeAr no radica solo en que nos ahorramos de escribir o entender c√≥digo, sino que tambi√©n evitamos tener que buscar y procesar las capas con las geometr√≠as de Argentina y rutas nacionales, siendo que trabajar con informaci√≥n geogr√°fica puede llegar a ser complejo.\nYendo un poco m√°s all√°‚Ä¶\nEn el caso de que queramos seguir personalizando el mapa, el tablero nos permite jugar con los par√°metros de color, tama√±o y forma (si se trata de puntos). Podemos, por ejemplo, asignar un color a los puntos en funci√≥n de una variable de nuestra base. Para esto deber√≠amos seleccionar la opci√≥n Seg√∫n variable en Color y luego elegir la variable categ√≥rica que nos sirva para colorear los puntos. Tambi√©n tenemos la opci√≥n de cargar un color espec√≠fico para cada punto, creando una columna que se llame color_hex en nuestra base y especificando el c√≥digo hexadecimal del color de cada registro (ver el modelo de data en la pesta√±a ¬øC√≥mo usar?).\nPor √∫ltimo, hay que tener en cuenta que se pueden sumar hasta tres capas personalizadas, adem√°s de las dos predefinidas y la capa base. Un recurso √∫til para consultar informaci√≥n geogr√°fica es el sitio del Instituto Geogr√°fico Nacional, donde se encuentran distintas bases que te pueden ayudar a crear mapas seg√∫n tus necesidades.\n¬øLista/o para mapear?\nLinks\nRecurso: https://tableros.yvera.tur.ar/mapeAr/\nRepositorio: https://github.com/dnme-minturdep/mapeAr\n\nEsta forma de escribir un color se conoce como sistema de numeraci√≥n hexadecimal, se utiliza para representar colores a trav√©s de un c√≥digo de 6 valores alfanum√©ricos precedido de un #.‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",

A su vez, a partir de\nla informaci√≥n que recoge la EOH en las localidades muestradas, para la\nconstrucci√≥n del marco muestral de inter√©s, se incorporan dichos\nregistros al padr√≥n de alojamiento.\nComo resultado el PUNA re√∫ne la informaci√≥n de los establecimientos\nde alojamiento tur√≠stico colectivo de la Argentina, detallando las\nprincipales variables de cada uno.\n¬øQU√â ES UN\nALOJAMIENTO TUR√çSTICO COLECTIVO?\nLos alojamientos tur√≠sticos colectivos son aquellos establecimientos\nde hospedaje que prestan servicios de alojamiento al viajero, ofreciendo\nhabitaciones u otro acomodo, si bien el n√∫mero de plazas debe ser\nsuperior a un m√≠nimo determinado, para grupos de personas que sobrepasan\nla unidad familiar y debe disponer, aunque no tenga fines de lucro, de\nuna administraci√≥n de tipo comercial com√∫n para todas las plazas del\nestablecimiento. Esta definici√≥n incluye a los establecimientos\nhoteleros, parahoteleros, especializados y otros establecimientos\ncolectivos (como los alojamientos de vacaciones; alojamientos de camping\ntur√≠stico; puertos; establecimientos de alojamiento tur√≠stico\nsocial).\n¬øQU√â PERMITE ANALIZAR EL\nPUNA?\nLos datos del PUNA permiten conocer para 1265 localidades del pa√≠s el\nstock de establecimientos, plazas y habitaciones disponibles seg√∫n el\ntipo y categor√≠a del establecimiento, n√∫mero de establecimientos y\nplazas de cadenas hoteleras y origen de la cadena.\nPor ejemplo, a partir de la base de alojamientos tur√≠sticos\ncolectivos agrupada podemos analizar c√≥mo se distribuy√≥ el stock de\nplazas de alojamiento colectivo a lo largo del pa√≠s durante el 2020 por\nprovincia.\n\n\nShow code\n\ndata_gg2 <- puna %>% \n#  filter(tipo == \"Hoteleros\") %>% \n  group_by(provincia) %>% \n  summarise(plazas = sum(as.numeric(plazas))) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n # mutate(orden = rank(-plazas)) %>% \n  arrange(-plazas) %>% \n  mutate(prov_limpio = limpiar_texto(provincia)) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(plazas))\n\n\nmapa_arg <- get_geo(\"ARGENTINA\", level = \"provincia\") %>% \n  add_geo_codes() %>% \n  mutate(prov_limpio = limpiar_texto(name_iso))\n\ndata_gg2 <- right_join(mapa_arg, data_gg2)\n\n\ndata_gg2 <- data_gg2 %>% \n  st_centroid(of_largest_polygon = T) \n\ndata_gg2 <- data_gg2 %>% \n  bind_cols(\n    sf::st_coordinates(data_gg2) %>%\n      as_tibble() %>%\n      rename(lon=X, lat=Y))\n\n# corregir centroide de salta\ndata_gg2 <- data_gg2 %>% \n  mutate(lon = ifelse(name_iso == \"Salta\", -64.59388437680094, lon),\n         lat = ifelse(name_iso == \"Salta\", -25.110770602277693, lat))\n\ndata_gg2 <- datos_grafico_pablo(data_gg2, variable = plazas)\n\n\nggplot(data_gg2) + #data\n  geom_sf(data=mapa_arg, size = .5, fill = \"transparent\", color = \"gray40\") + # mapa base\n  geom_point(aes(x=lon, y=lat, color=plazas)) + #data: puntos\n  geom_sigmoid(\n    aes(x=lon, y=lat, xend=sigmoid_end, yend=col_y, group=name_iso, color=plazas)\n  ) + #data: lineas\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label=name_iso, x=sigmoid_end, y=col_y\n        #color=plazas\n        ), color = \"black\", fontface = \"bold\",\n    hjust=1, size=4, vjust=0, nudge_y = 0.5, alpha=0.8,\n  ) + #data: etiquetas\n  geom_segment(\n    aes(x = col_x_start, xend = col_x_end, y = col_y, yend = col_y, color = plazas),\n    size = 4.2, alpha = .9, \n    lineend = \"round\"\n  ) + #data: barras\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label=area_label, x=col_x_end, y=col_y, color=plazas),\n    hjust=-0.1, size=5, nudge_x = .3\n  ) + #data: valores\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"Plazas en alojamientos colectivos por provincia.

En esta oportunidad nos ocuparemos de la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH).\nA partir de esta encuesta se obtiene informaci√≥n desagregada del comportamiento tur√≠stico de los hogares de nuestro pa√≠s y permite tomar dimensi√≥n, en t√©rminos econ√≥micos, del peso del turismo interno en el conjunto del consumo de bienes y servicios tur√≠sticos en la Argentina. Con dicha informaci√≥n se pueden efectuar estudios anal√≠ticos de los diferentes determinantes de la actividad tur√≠stica de los residentes en nuestro pa√≠s y, por tanto, dise√±ar e implementar pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas sectoriales con mayor eficacia y eficiencia.\nPrincipales objetivos\nEste operativo tiene como principales objetivos medir:\nLa evoluci√≥n de los viajes realizados por los hogares en el periodo de referencia\nLas caracter√≠sticas de los recorridos tur√≠sticos (lugares visitados, forma de alojamiento, estad√≠as, utilizaci√≥n de paquete tur√≠stico, medios de transporte, etc.)\nLos viajes a segundas viviendas\nEl gasto de cada uno de los viajes\nLos aspectos socio-demogr√°ficos de los hogares viajeros (ingreso total del hogar, ocupaci√≥n principal del jefe de hogar, etc.).\nMarco conceptual: definici√≥n de viaje tur√≠stico\nSiguiendo las definiciones habituales y las recomendaciones internacionales de la Organizaci√≥n Mundial del Turismo, a los efectos del relevamiento de la EVyTH, se define como viaje de turismo a todo aquel desplazamiento realizado por todos, algunos o al menos uno de los miembros del hogar fuera de su entorno habitual (las segundas viviendas por definici√≥n no forman parte). Debe tenerse en cuenta que:\nDebe tener una duraci√≥n inferior a un a√±o y quien viaj√≥ no haber fijado su residencia en el lugar de destino.\nComprende los traslados, estancias y todas las actividades que las personas realizan en el lugar de destino.\nPuede haber ido a un s√≥lo destino o haber tenido varias etapas.\nUnidades de an√°lisis\nEl marco conceptual antes definido permite obtener conclusiones a partir de diversas unidades de an√°lisis. A continuaci√≥n, se las repasan junto con una breve descripci√≥n de cada una de ellas:\nHogar: es la persona o grupo de personas, parientes o no, que habitan bajo un mismo techo en un r√©gimen de tipo familiar; es decir, comparten sus gastos en alimentaci√≥n con cargo a un mismo presupuesto.\nPersona: cada uno de los individuos integrantes de un hogar.\nTurista: significa el desplazamiento que realiza una persona fuera del entorno habitual, con una duraci√≥n inferior al a√±o, pernoctando en el/los lugar/es de destino, por cualquier motivo excepto de ser empleado por una unidad residentes.\nVisita de un d√≠a: es el recorrido de una persona fuera del entorno habitual sin pernoctar en el lugar de destino.\nPernoctaci√≥n: se trata de una noche de alojamiento de una persona.\nPrincipales caracter√≠sticas de la encuesta\nLa EVyTH es una encuesta por muestreo, cuya captaci√≥n se lleva adelante bajo la metodolog√≠a CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing). El universo bajo estudio de la encuesta son los grandes aglomerados urbanos definidos en la EPH del INDEC. Por lo tanto, se consideran 32 aglomerados agrupados en 8 regiones (Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires, Partidos del Gran Buenos Aires, Resto de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, C√≥rdoba, regi√≥n del Litoral, Norte, Cuyo y Patag√≥nica).\nEl tama√±o de muestra mensual es de 2.600 hogares distribuidos entre todos los aglomerados. La ventana de observaci√≥n es bimensual, esto es, se indaga por los viajes realizados durante los √∫ltimos dos meses. De esta forma, con el mecanismo de per√≠odos de referencia y ventanas de observaci√≥n implementados se logra que, para un mes determinado, se disponga de 5.200 casos para realizar las estimaciones de ese mes.\nEstos y muchos m√°s aspectos se pueden profundizar en el recientemente publicado Documento Metodol√≥gico.\n\nüìù VER DOCUMENTO METODOL√ìGICO\n¬øCu√°ntos viajes tur√≠sticos por a√±o realizan las personas residentes en Argentina?\n\n\nShow code\n\n### Cargo librer√≠as\nlibrary(comunicacion) # DNMyE - Comunicaci√≥n, [github::dnme-minturdep/comunicacion] v0.0.0.9\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Easily Install and Load the 'Tidyverse', CRAN v1.3.1\nlibrary(ggrepel) # Automatically Position Non-Overlapping Text Labels with 'ggplot2', CRAN v0.9.1\nlibrary(gt) # Easily Create Presentation-Ready Display Tables, CRAN v0.6.0\nlibrary(gtExtras) # Extending 'gt' for Beautiful HTML Tables, [github::jthomasmock/gtExtras] v0.4.0\nsource(\"funciones.R\")\n\n# Saco notacion cientifica\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##  ~ Carga de la base de datos  ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nurl <- \"http://datos.yvera.gob.ar/dataset/b5819e9b-5edf-4aad-bd39-a81158a2b3f3/resource/645e5505-68ee-4cfa-90f9-fcc9a4a34a85/download/evyth_microdatos.csv\"\n\nb_orig <- read_csv(url)\n\n### Cargo operaciones de limpieza / armado de la base de datos\nsource(\"metadata.R\", encoding = \"UTF-8\")\n\n\n\nEste es uno de los principales objetivos a cumplir por el relevamiento de la EVyTH. Y para alcanzarlo se realizan entrevistas de forma mensual en aras de relevar si en los hogares se ha realizado alg√∫n viaje en los √∫ltimos dos meses.

En esta oportunidad nos ocuparemos de la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI) y de la Estimaci√≥n Nacional del turismo internacional en Argentina. En este post nos focalizaremos s√≥lo en el turismo receptivo (turistas no residentes que visitan Argentina) para luego, en otra ocasi√≥n, avocarnos al turismo emisivo. Se mostrar√°n los principales datos, el perfil de los turistas no residentes que visitan la Argentina y los aspectos m√°s relevantes del operativo.\n¬øCu√°ntos turistas no residentes recibe la Argentina por a√±o?\nPara responder esta pregunta tenemos que referirnos a los datos que se elaboran desde la DNMyE correspondientes a la Estimaci√≥n Nacional del total de turistas no residentes en Argentina por todos los medios de transporte utilizados, estos son: a√©reos, terrestres y fluviales/mar√≠timos.\nLa fuente principal de dichos n√∫meros son los registros migratorios de 225 pasos internacionales, provistos por la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones del Ministerio del Interior, y la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (de la cual hablaremos un poco m√°s adelante). Con dicha informaci√≥n, y siguiendo las recomendaciones internacionales de la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de Turismo (OMT), elaboramos las cifras del turismo receptivo y emisivo de Argentina.\n\nüìù VER DOCUMENTO METODOL√ìGICO\n\n\nShow code\n\n### Cargo librer√≠as\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Easily Install and Load the 'Tidyverse' \nlibrary(data.table) # Extension of `data.frame`\nlibrary(haven) # Import and Export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files\nlibrary(readxl) # Read Excel Files\nlibrary(comunicacion) # DNMyE - Comunicaci√≥n\nlibrary(glue) # Interpreted String Literals \nlibrary(plotly) # Create Interactive Web Graphics via 'plotly.js'\nlibrary(lubridate) # Make Dealing with Dates a Little Easier \nlibrary(treemapify) # Draw Treemaps in 'ggplot2'\nlibrary(sf) # Simple Features for R\n\n\n#saco notacion cientifica\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\n\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##  ~ Carga de la base de datos  ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nbase_tur_internac <- readRDS(\"/srv/DataDNMYE/turismo_internacional/turismo_internacional_pais.rds\")\n\nsource(\"armo_tablas_turismo_internacional.R\")\n\nbase_eti_2019 <- read_sav(\"/srv/DataDNMYE/eti/ETI E 2019.sav\") %>% \n  zap_label() %>% \n  zap_labels()\n                  \nsource(\"armo_tablas_eti.R\")\n\n\n#grafico serie turismo internacional por via\n\ngraf_serie_via_ti <- ggplot(tabla_serie_via_ti, aes(periodo, turistas, fill =via,\n                                                    group = via,\n                                                    text=paste0(format(periodo,'%B %Y'),\"\\n\",format(turistas, big.mark = \".\",decimal.mark = \",\", digits = 1),\" turistas\")\n                                                    ))+\n  geom_area() +\n  scale_fill_dnmye() + \n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 months\", date_labels = \"%b%y\", expand = c(0,10))+ \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(min(tabla_serie_via_ti$turistas), max(sum(tabla_serie_via_ti$turistas)), by = 200000), \n                     labels = scales::number_format(big.mark = \".\", decimal.mark = \",\")) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        axis.text.x =element_text (size = 8, angle=90),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11),\n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        legend.text = element_text (size =12),\n        plot.caption =  element_text (size =12, hjust = 0.0)) +\n  labs(title = \"Evoluci√≥n mensual del turismo internacional receptivo, por medio de transporte\",\n       subtitle = glue (\"Total pa√≠s.

el a√±o 2019, antes del colapso de la pandemia, Argentina recibi√≥ 7,4 millones de turistas no residentes por todos los pasos internacionales, principalmente por la v√≠a terrestre y la v√≠a a√©rea (44% y 41%, respectivamente).\nEn el gr√°fico se muestra la evoluci√≥n mensual del turismo receptivo, donde es posible observar la estacionalidad propia de la actividad tur√≠stica: los picos del verano, la temporada baja y el repunte en invierno por la llegada de turistas internacionales a los principales destinos de nieve. Tambi√©n vemos all√≠ la ca√≠da estrepitosa en los a√±os 2020 y 2021 producto de la pandemia.\nA partir del mes de octubre de 2021 se observa que el n√∫mero de turistas internacionales ¬°vuelve a mostrar signos de vida y comienza a tener mayor dinamismo!\nTambi√©n nos podemos preguntar, cu√°l es el principal mercado que nos visita. Y para ello, analizaremos los datos seg√∫n los principales pa√≠ses de residencia de los turistas extranjeros seg√∫n el medio de transporte utilizado. Veamos el siguiente gr√°fico:\n\n\nShow code\n\ngraf_pais_ti <- ggplot(tabla_pais_ti) +   \n  geom_bar(aes(x= pais_agrupado, weight= turistas_porc, fill =via))+\n  scale_fill_dnmye() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"grey\", alpha =0.7, size = 0.5) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        axis.text.x =element_text (size =11, angle=45, vjust = 0.6),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.text = element_text (size =12),\n        plot.caption =  element_text (size =12, hjust = 0.0)) +\n  labs(title = \"Turismo internacional receptivo por pa√≠s de residencia seg√∫n medio de transporte\",\n       subtitle = \"Total pa√≠s. A√±o 2019\",\n       y = \"\", \n       x = \"\", \n       color= \"\",\n       fill=\"\",\n       caption =  \"Fuente: Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estadstica, Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes\" )\n\ngraf_pais_ti\n\n\n\n\nBrasil ocup√≥ el primer lugar y represent√≥ el 20% del total de las llegadas del a√±o 2019, principalmente utilizando medios de transporte a√©reos. Luego, se ubica Chile (15%) pero la v√≠a terrestre es el medio principal para este mercado. Los turistas europeos son otro mercado de importancia (14%), principalmente por los medios a√©reos.\nPara seguir analizando y respondiendo otras preguntas del turismo internacional en Argentina, te invitamos a que juegues con el Tablero de datos del turismo internacional, en el cual podr√°s filtrar la informaci√≥n que desees y conocer m√°s sobre el movimiento de turistas no residentes en nuestro pa√≠s (a√±o, mes, pa√≠s de residencia, paso, entre otras variables).\n¬øQu√© caracter√≠sticas tiene el turista internacional que nos visita?\nPara conocer un poco m√°s sobre el perfil del turista receptivo, nos enfocaremos en la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI). Este relevamiento es coordinado entre el Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes de la Naci√≥n y el Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos (INDEC) desde el a√±o 2004 hasta la actualidad. El principal objetivo es conocer las caracter√≠sticas tanto de los viajes (el motivo, la duraci√≥n, el/los destino/s, el/los tipos de alojamientos utilizados, etc.) como de los viajeros (lugar de residencia, conformaci√≥n del grupo familiar que viaja, etc.), como tambi√©n los gastos que realiz√≥ durante su estad√≠a (en alojamiento, alimentaci√≥n, entre otros).\nLa ETI se releva, principalmente, en pasos a√©reos: Aerop. Internacional de Ezeiza, Aeroparque J. Newbery, Aerop. internacional de C√≥rdoba y de Mendoza. Tambi√©n se releva en el Puerto de Buenos Aires y en el paso fronterizo terrestre Cristo Redentor que limita con Chile. En su conjunto, represent√≥ aproximadamente el movimiento del 46% del total del turismo receptivo en la Argentina (a√±o 2019).\nA partir de la informaci√≥n que nos brinda la ETI, y a modo de resumen, te presentamos el perfil del turista no residente promedio. All√≠ se sintetiza la informaci√≥n de las principales caracter√≠sticas de los turistas no residentes durante el a√±o 2019.\nPerfil del turista no residenteA su vez, tambi√©n es posible cruzar los datos por diferentes variables de inter√©s. A continuaci√≥n, te mostramos cu√°les son los principales tipos de alojamiento utilizados por los diferentes motivos de viaje.\nLos hoteles de mayor categor√≠a, los 4 y 5 estrellas, son los m√°s demandados por aquellos que nos visitan por vacaciones/ocio/recreaci√≥n y por negocios (siendo en este √∫ltimo, mayor su participaci√≥n). Como es de esperar, Casa de familiares y/o amigos es el principal alojamiento de aquellos que vinieron a visitar a los familiares y se hospedan all√≠. Los hoteles de 1,2 y 3 estrellas se ubican como el segundo tipo de alojamiento m√°s utilizado por los turistas de vacaciones.\n\n\nShow code\n\n# ETI.

Europa presenta la mayor estad√≠a, casi 20 d√≠as en promedio en el a√±o 2019, con un gasto promedio por viajero de \\(USD 1370\\). Los pa√≠ses que incluye la categor√≠a Resto de Am√©rica son los que tambi√©n presentaron estad√≠as largas; 18,8 en promedio, con un gasto por viajero promedio de \\(USD 1107\\). Los pa√≠ses lim√≠trofes permanecen menos tiempo, siendo Bolivia el que registr√≥ una mayor estad√≠a promedio (12 d√≠as promedio) con un gasto por viajero de \\(USD 730\\). EE.UU. y Canad√° son los que registraron el mayor gasto diario promedio (\\(USD 97,4\\)) y, en menor medida, los turistas brasile√±os (\\(USD 97,1\\)).\n\n\nShow code\n\n# ETI.

Los valores culturales y la variedad de tradiciones fue el aspecto m√°s relevante para el turista receptivo en el a√±o 2019. El 27,4% respondi√≥ que dicho aspecto fue el m√°s significativo. Luego, la diversidad de la naturaleza y los paisajes fue el segundo m√°s determinante (16,2% de los turistas).

Se mostrar√°n las principales caracter√≠sticas de la encuesta como tambi√©n los resultados m√°s relevantes.\nPrimero, lo primero‚Ä¶\n¬øQu√© es la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH)?\nLa EOH es un relevamiento coordinado entre el Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes de la Naci√≥n y el Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos (INDEC) que se realiza de manera continua desde el a√±o 2004 hasta la actualidad.\nEl principal objetivo es la medici√≥n del impacto del turismo internacional e interno en los establecimientos hoteleros y para-hoteleros del pa√≠s. Para ello, se encuesta todos los meses a una muestra de m√°s de 3 mil hoteles del pa√≠s.\nUno de los datos interesantes para analizar de la EOH es la estacionalidad, propia de la actividad tur√≠stica.

Los hoteles de los destinos tur√≠sticos m√°s importantes del pa√≠s alojan a miles de turistas durante los meses de enero, febrero y marzo mientras en el resto del a√±o, la actividad merma. No obstante, tambi√©n en las vacaciones de invierno, se puede observar otro pico de actividad, siendo julio el mes de mayor dinamismo, producto del receso escolar que se disfruta en todas las provincias de nuestro pa√≠s.\nDe la misma manera, esto se puede apreciar en la tasa de ocupaci√≥n hotelera, otro indicador que nos ofrece la encuesta, en las 49 localidades tur√≠sticas relevadas por la EOH; entre ellas, podemos mencionar la localidad costera de Villa Gesell con una estacionalidad marcada en verano para luego descender en el resto del a√±o; Tambi√©n en S. C. de Bariloche, con una ocupaci√≥n elevada en el verano, pero a√∫n m√°s durante los meses de invierno donde el turismo de nieve pasa a ser una actividad muy importante para los destinos de la Patagonia, siendo as√≠ que la ocupaci√≥n en dichos meses supera la registrada en la temporada estival. En otras localidades, como es el caso de S. M. de Tucum√°n, se observa una actividad hotelera y parahotelera m√°s constante durante todo el a√±o.\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"x\":[17897,17928,17956,17987,18017,18048,18078,18109,18140,18170,18201,18231],\"y\":[48.5800799256738,40.9583003036813,35.7241633236718,28.7004168180556,27.1084054431673,36.5069765542865,62.1900061072676,61.3429818240051,53.3272627804223,43.9317326549001,35.6808421806036,46.6187047490673],\"text\":[\"49%\",\"41%\",\"36%\",\"29%\",\"27%\",\"37%\",\"62%\",\"61%\",\"53%\",\"44%\",\"36%\",\"47%\"],\"type\":\"scatter\",\"mode\":\"lines+markers\",\"line\":{\"width\":7.55905511811024,\"color\":\"rgba(238,61,143,1)\",\"dash\":\"solid\"},\"hoveron\":\"points\",\"name\":\"Bariloche\",\"legendgroup\":\"Bariloche\",\"showlegend\":true,\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"marker\":{\"autocolorscale\":false,\"color\":\"rgba(238,61,143,1)\",\"opacity\":1,\"size\":11.3385826771654,\"symbol\":\"circle\",\"line\":{\"width\":1.88976377952756,\"color\":\"rgba(238,61,143,1)\"}},\"frame\":null},{\"x\":[17897,17928,17956,17987,18017,18048,18078,18109,18140,18170,18201,18231],\"y\":[26.1026170281114,30.9845155890354,28.4485599198424,30.7651991614256,27.2153190794398,28.8021052631579,41.9694826742099,33.0312253716336,34.2333614153328,31.3999648928557,29.4970231985219,25.3583051072591],\"text\":[\"26%\",\"31%\",\"28%\",\"31%\",\"27%\",\"29%\",\"42%\",\"33%\",\"34%\",\"31%\",\"29%\",\"25%\"],\"type\":\"scatter\",\"mode\":\"lines+markers\",\"line\":{\"width\":7.55905511811024,\"color\":\"rgba(247,148,30,1)\",\"dash\":\"solid\"},\"hoveron\":\"points\",\"name\":\"Tucum√°n\",\"legendgroup\":\"Tucum√°n\",\"showlegend\":true,\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"marker\":{\"autocolorscale\":false,\"color\":\"rgba(247,148,30,1)\",\"opacity\":1,\"size\":11.3385826771654,\"symbol\":\"circle\",\"line\":{\"width\":1.88976377952756,\"color\":\"rgba(247,148,30,1)\"}},\"frame\":null},{\"x\":[17897,17928,17956,17987,18017,18048,18078,18109,18140,18170,18201,18231],\"y\":[59.700673721583,61.9868378161699,30.9812106175286,16.1819938374998,4.09228600278154,3.28145758208389,12.9533734653807,6.25668038970005,7.24861027024052,8.50482709895876,15.0587061559011,32.0833125412377],\"text\":[\"60%\",\"62%\",\"31%\",\"16%\",\" 4%\",\" 3%\",\"13%\",\" 6%\",\" 7%\",\" 9%\",\"15%\",\"32%\"],\"type\":\"scatter\",\"mode\":\"lines+markers\",\"line\":{\"width\":7.55905511811024,\"color\":\"rgba(146,131,190,1)\",\"dash\":\"solid\"},\"hoveron\":\"points\",\"name\":\"Villa Gesell\",\"legendgroup\":\"Villa Gesell\",\"showlegend\":true,\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"marker\":{\"autocolorscale\":false,\"color\":\"rgba(146,131,190,1)\",\"opacity\":1,\"size\":11.3385826771654,\"symbol\":\"circle\",\"line\":{\"width\":1.88976377952756,\"color\":\"rgba(146,131,190,1)\"}},\"frame\":null},{\"x\":[17887,18241],\"y\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"scatter\",\"mode\":\"lines\",\"line\":{\"width\":1.88976377952756,\"color\":\"rgba(190,190,190,0.7)\",\"dash\":\"solid\"},\"hoveron\":\"points\",\"showlegend\":false,\"xaxis\":\"x\",\"yaxis\":\"y\",\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"frame\":null}],\"layout\":{\"margin\":{\"t\":49.6073059360731,\"r\":7.30593607305936,\"b\":54.7945205479452,\"l\":34.337899543379},\"font\":{\"color\":\"rgba(0,0,0,1)\",\"family\":\"\",\"size\":14.6118721461187},\"title\":{\"text\":\"Tasa de ocupaci√≥n en plazas, seg√∫n mes.<br><sup>Villa Gesell, Tucum√°n, Bariloche.

En algunas localidades, ambos porcentajes son similares, no mostrando una actividad tur√≠stica diferente durante la semana y el fin de semana. De lo contrario, en otras localidades, la ocupaci√≥n entre ambos periodos difiere, siendo la ocupaci√≥n del mes m√°s alta a la del fin de semana (Corrientes, por ejemplo). Esos casos representan lo que ocurre generalmente en los centros urbanos, donde se ve una mayor actividad durante la semana y luego cae durante los fines de semana. Por el contrario, se encuentran destinos que durante el fin de semana la actividad se incrementa (Villa General Belgrano, por ejemplo) en comparaci√≥n con el resto de la semana, generando entonces tasas de ocupaci√≥n mensuales m√°s bajas a las del fin de semana.\n\n\n\n¬øQu√© localidades forman parte del relevamiento?\nCuando comenz√≥ el operativo en el a√±o 2004, se relevaban 17 localidades, seleccionadas en funci√≥n de la relevancia tur√≠stica. Con el objetivo de obtener representatividad de datos a nivel regional, en el a√±o 2005, la cantidad de localidades relevadas ascendieron a 39. Con el paso de los a√±os se sumaron m√°s destinos hasta llegar a las 49 localidades que forman parte de la EOH en la actualidad, las cuales podemos apreciar en el siguiente mapa\n\n\n\nOtro de los datos interesantes que la EOH produce es la cantidad de viajeros y pernoctes seg√∫n el origen de dichos viajeros, distinguiendo entre residentes y no residentes.\nEn los gr√°ficos a continuaci√≥n se ve el porcentaje de participaci√≥n de los pernoctes de los viajeros residentes y no residentes para el a√±o 2019 en diferentes localidades relevadas por la encuesta.\n\n\n\nHay ciertos destinos tur√≠sticos que reciben, en gran medida, turismo internacional como es el caso de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Puerto Iguaz√∫ y Ushuaia. La participaci√≥n de los viajeros no residentes hospedados en los hoteles y parahoteles en estos destinos representan un alto porcentaje del total de pernoctes registrados. Por ejemplo, en Ushuaia casi 3 de cada 5 turistas que pernoctan all√≠ en los alojamientos hoteleros y parahoteleros, son no residentes.\nPor el contrario, destinos como Villa Carlos Paz, Resistencia, Las Grutas son lugares con mayor cantidad de turistas internos. En este caso, el turismo receptivo representa una peque√±a proporci√≥n mientras que el turismo dom√©stico, explica m√°s del 90% de los pernoctes registrados en el sector hoteleros y parahotelero.\nEsto tambi√©n se puede analizar a un nivel m√°s agregado, por regiones tur√≠sticas:\n\n\n\n¬øQu√© tipo de establecimientos forman parte del universo de relevamiento de la EOH?\nSe encuestan a:\nEstablecimientos Hoteleros:\nHoteles de 1 a 5 estrellas\nApart Hoteles\nHoteles Boutiques\nEstablecimientos Para-hoteleros:\nAlbergues/hostels\nCaba√±as / Bungalows\nHoteles Sindicales\nHospedajes / residenciales\nHoster√≠as\nLa EOH permite conocer la cantidad de noches y viajeros hospedados por diferentes categor√≠as hoteleras. A nivel nacional y regional se puede analizar los datos seg√∫n las siguientes categor√≠as hoteleras:\n- Establecimientos Hoteleros:\nHotel 1 y 2 estrellas\nHotel 3 estrellas, boutique y apart hotel\nHotel 4 y 5 estrellas\n- Establecimientos Para-hoteleros\nY para las localidades, la apertura de publicaci√≥n de los datos es m√°s agregada:\nEstablecimientos Hoteleros\nEstablecimientos Para-hoteleros\nEn el gr√°fico a continuaci√≥n se muestra el total de pernoctes del a√±o 2019 seg√∫n la participaci√≥n porcentual de las diferentes categor√≠as hoteleras. Tambi√©n se puede analizar esto mismo para cada regi√≥n tur√≠stica.\n\n\n\nLos hoteles de 3 estrellas, Aparts y hoteles boutiques acumularon la mayor cantidad de noches (31% del total), sigui√©ndole los hoteles de 4 y 5 estrellas (28,8%).\nSin embargo, cuando se mira a nivel regional, la situaci√≥n es diferente en cada una de ellas. En la regi√≥n Buenos Aires y C√≥rdoba, la participaci√≥n de los hoteles 4 y 5 estrellas es la m√°s baja comparativamente al resto de las regiones (16% y 10%, respectivamente) mientras que en CABA y en Litoral, su participaci√≥n asciende significativamente (47% y 36%, respectivamente). Los hoteles de 1 y 2 estrellas toman fuerza en la regi√≥n C√≥rdoba (34%), los parahoteleros, en la regi√≥n Buenos Aires (34%)y los hoteles de 3 estrellas, Aparts y Boutiques, en la regi√≥n Cuyo (37%)\n\n\n\nPrincipales indicadores que se pueden producir a partir de la EOH\nAdem√°s de todo lo que mostramos hasta ahora ( cantidad de viajeros alojados, pernoctaciones, tasas de ocupaci√≥n en habitaciones/unididades y plazas), tambi√©n se puede encontrar otros indicadores:\nEstad√≠a promedio: cantidad de noches promedio por viajero hospedado.\nFacturaci√≥n total en pesos: ingresos percibidos por los establecimientos por la totalidad de servicios ofrecidos (a valores expresados en pesos argentinos).\nIngresos por habitaci√≥n disponible: tarifa promedio por cada habitaci√≥n disponible (lo que se conoce en ingl√©s como RevPar -revenue per available room-).\nTarifa media diaria: tarifa promedio por cada habitaci√≥n ocupada (tambi√©n conocido como ADR -average daily room-).\nPuestos de trabajo totales: cantidad de puestos de trabajo empleados en los establecimientos.\nPuestos de trabajo equivalentes: cantidad de puestos de trabajo empleados en los establecimientos, que se calculan tomando como referencia una jornada a tiempo completo (45 horas semanales).\nSobre la publicaci√≥n de los informes\nPor √∫ltimo, es importante que sepas d√≥nde podes encontrar todos la info de la EOH. Los resultados son publicados 50 d√≠as (aproximadamente) posteriores al mes vencido.\nPodes encontrarlos en tanto en el Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de la Arge ntina (SINTA), como en el sitio del INDEC.\nA su vez, se encuentra disponible mucha info en formato abierto para que puedas descargarlos f√°cilmente en nuestro portal de Datos Abiertos.\n\n\n\n",

Adicionalmente, constituyen una fuente de informaci√≥n privilegiada para analizar el gasto tur√≠stico que realizan los diferentes tipos de visitantes, sirviendo como insumo para la estimaci√≥n del impacto econ√≥mico de la actividad.\nLa principal herramienta con la que se cuenta para obtener informaci√≥n es la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH). Este es un operativo por muestreo cuyo principal objetivo es proporcionar informaci√≥n sobre los viajes tur√≠sticos de los residentes en Argentina hacia dentro y fuera del pa√≠s: cu√°ndo viajan, hacia d√≥nde viajan, qu√© medios de transporte utilizan, d√≥nde se alojan, cu√°les son los motivos por los que viajan, c√≥mo organizan sus viajes, qu√© actividades tur√≠sticas realizan, cu√°nto gastan, etc.\nEn este sentido, tal y como se lo propuso con el desarrollo del SINTA, la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica pone a disposici√≥n del p√∫blico general el conjunto de datos relevados por la Encuesta Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH-MINTURDEP). Se podr√° acceder y descargar a dicha informaci√≥n a trav√©s de la secci√≥n del Portal de Datos Abiertos que contiene los DATASETS referidos al Turismo Interno, junto al resto de los recursos que la DNMyE publica peri√≥dicamente (Sector Hotelero, Turismo Internacional, etc.).\nEste operativo se trata de una encuesta a hogares, en la que se indaga por los viajes tur√≠sticos (viajes con pernocte y/o visitas de un d√≠a) realizados por todas las personas que componen el hogar a lugares ubicados fuera de su entorno habitual. El universo bajo estudio abarca a hogares residentes en los aglomerados urbanos definidos para la Encuesta Permanente a Hogares del INDEC -EPH- (62% del total de la poblaci√≥n argentina, aproximadamente), excluyendo de este modo a los residentes en ciudades medianas y peque√±as, en pueblos y en zonas rurales. En cambio, el an√°lisis de los resultados por destino contempla a todas las ciudades o localidades del pa√≠s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplorando la base de datos\nEntre las primeras posibilidades que provee la disponibilidad de la base es la de tener un diagn√≥stico completo del comportamiento tur√≠stico, al menos para el per√≠odo desde el cual existe el operativo que recauda dicha informaci√≥n.\nCantidad de visitantes por tipo de visitante. 31 aglomerados urbanos.\nInformaci√≥n trimestral.

Es decir, la demanda de los visitantes emerge como lo determinante y solo a partir de esta se genera la actividad econ√≥mica asociada al turismo. Con esta l√≥gica, el primer bloque de Tablas de la CST-A se dedica al consumo de los visitantes.\nBloque 1: demanda del visitante\nEl Bloque 1: demanda del visitante lo componen 4 Tablas dedicadas al gasto y al consumo de los visitantes.\n\n‚Ä¢ La Tabla 1 presenta el gasto del turismo receptor por tipo de visitante (turista o excursionista) y por producto caracter√≠stico del turismo. El turismo receptor son las actividades de los visitantes no residentes en el pa√≠s. La principal fuente de informaci√≥n para la CST-A es la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI) elaborada por el MINTURDEP y el INDEC, y las cuentas viajes y pasajeros de la balanza de pagos del INDEC.\n‚Ä¢ La Tabla 2 presenta el gasto del turismo interno por tipo de visitante (turista o excursionista) y por producto caracter√≠stico del turismo. El turismo interno son las actividades de los visitantes residentes en el pa√≠s, durante sus viajes dentro de este o como parte de un viaje con destino en el exterior. La fuente de informaci√≥n principal de la CST-A es la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH) elaborada por el MINTURDEP.\n‚Ä¢ La Tabla 3 presenta el gasto del turismo emisor por tipo de visitante (turista o excursionista) y por producto caracter√≠stico del turismo. El turismo emisivo son las actividades de los visitantes residentes en el pa√≠s durante los viajes en el exterior del pa√≠s. Como se puede notar en el esquema, esta Tabla no se vincula con otras Tablas de la CST-A puesto que todo el gasto que realicen los visitantes argentinos con proveedores del exterior no afecta la producci√≥n de la econom√≠a nacional.\n‚Ä¢ La Tabla 4 conduce a la estimaci√≥n del consumo tur√≠stico interior al sumar el gasto tur√≠stico receptor, el gasto tur√≠stico interno (Tablas 1 y 2) y los otros componentes del consumo tur√≠stico interior. En la CST-A dentro de los ‚Äúotros componentes‚Äù se incluy√≥ el valor de uso de segundas viviendas tur√≠sticas en propiedad de los residentes. La Tabla 4 es medular, en el sentido de que contiene toda la demanda de los visitantes que luego ser√° valuada en su aporte a la econom√≠a.\nEn la CST-A se estimaron las Tablas 1, 2 y 4 para el a√±o base 2004 y para el a√±o 2018 debido a la mayor informaci√≥n del gasto tur√≠stico discriminado por producto en las fuentes espec√≠ficas (ETI y EVyTH) y por la posibilidad de conciliar la demanda con la oferta de esos productos en la econom√≠a, como veremos m√°s adelante.\nBloque 2: Oferta de la industria\nViremos ahora la mirada hacia la oferta tur√≠stica en la CST-A. El Bloque 2: Oferta de la industria lo compone una √∫nica Tabla, la Tabla 5.\n\nEsta Tabla presenta las cuentas de producci√≥n de las industrias tur√≠sticas. Estas cuentas exponen el valor de la producci√≥n, el valor de los consumos intermedios para su elaboraci√≥n y valor agregado como diferencia entre estos dos √≠tems.\nLa importancia de la Tabla 5 radica en que permite conocer la dimensi√≥n y las relaciones sectoriales de los productores caracter√≠sticos del turismo. Por otro lado, en funci√≥n de la apertura lograda en las actividades caracter√≠sticas, impacta en la calidad de la medici√≥n del valor agregado generado por el consumo del visitante.\nLa CST:RMC, 2008 propone una selecci√≥n de industrias caracter√≠sticas del turismo (que le suma lo ‚Äúinternacionalmente comparable‚Äù) con base en la identificaci√≥n de los productos caracter√≠sticos del turismo en la demanda de los visitantes1.\nEn la CST-A los cuadros de oferta y utilizaci√≥n (COU) de las cuentas nacionales son la materia prima para su elaboraci√≥n. Los COU y por lo tanto la Tabla 5 de la CST-A se elaboraron para el a√±o base 2004 y el a√±o 2018. Por ello, las aperturas de los productos y actividades en cada a√±o responde al detalle y disponibilidad de la informaci√≥n existente.\nDe esta Tabla surgen indicadores de s√≠ntesis econ√≥micos del turismo, como el valor bruto de producci√≥n de la industria del turismo (VBPIT) o el valor agregado de la industria del turismo (VABIT). Ambos describen la dimensi√≥n de las industrias caracter√≠sticas y puede compararse con el total de la econom√≠a, pero n√≥tese que estos indicadores contienen producci√≥n no demandada por visitantes as√≠ como, en el sentido contrario, no contienen producci√≥n consumida por visitantes (porque la industria que lo produjo no fue seleccionada como caracter√≠stica). Por ejemplo, estos indicadores incluyen toda producci√≥n de los restaurantes, cuando gran parte de esta producci√≥n no es consumida por visitantes, as√≠ como no incluye producci√≥n de artesan√≠as (CST:RMC, 2008 no incluye inicialmente ramas productoras de bienes en las caracter√≠sticas del turismo).\nPara salvar esta instancia y proponer indicadores m√°s espec√≠ficos, la CST:RMC, 2008 avanza hacia la confrontaci√≥n global del consumo tur√≠stico interior y la oferta interna como veremos en el Bloque 3.\nBloque 3: confrontaci√≥n oferta y demanda\nEn el Bloque 3: confrontaci√≥n oferta y demanda se elabora la Tabla 6, donde confluyen la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5, que se completa con informaci√≥n de los COU para obtener la oferta interna disponible de los productos caracter√≠sticos (y otros) valuada a precios de adquisici√≥n: las importaciones, los impuestos a los productos netos de subsidios y los m√°rgenes de comercio y transporte. Entonces, la demanda de los visitantes es confrontada con la oferta interna a precios de adquisici√≥n y se obtienen los ratios tur√≠sticos por producto (que indica la parte de la oferta interna que fue consumida por visitantes).\n\nA partir de estos ratios tur√≠sticos por productos, para cada industria, es posible establecer la proporci√≥n tur√≠stica de la producci√≥n (en t√©rminos de valor) como la suma de la proporci√≥n tur√≠stica que corresponde a cada una de sus producciones. As√≠ pues, para cada industria puede establecerse un ratio tur√≠stico de la producci√≥n (la relaci√≥n entre el valor total de la proporci√≥n tur√≠stica y el valor total de la producci√≥n de la industria), que se aplicar√° a los componentes del consumo intermedio (y, por ende, al valor agregado).\nPor consiguiente, puede establecerse para cada industria una estimaci√≥n de la parte de su valor agregado que corresponde a la contribuci√≥n de su producci√≥n al consumo tur√≠stico interior total de todas las industrias, tur√≠sticas o no. Se denomina valor agregado bruto directo tur√≠stico (VABDT) a la suma de las partes de valor a√±adido de todas las industrias. Para obtener el producto interior bruto directo tur√≠stico (PIBDT), generado por el consumo tur√≠stico interior, es necesario a√±adir al VABDT los impuestos netos de subvenciones sobre los productos e importaciones tur√≠sticos que se estiman del mismo modo: utilizando el porcentaje correspondiente para cada producto.\nEl VABDT y el PIBDT utilizados como principales indicadores de la contribuci√≥n directa del turismo al valor agregado total o al PIB total se obtienen de la Tabla 6.\nEs por esto que la Tabla 6 constituye el n√∫cleo central de la cuenta sat√©lite de turismo: de no elaborarse, a√∫n a partir de datos parciales, el t√©rmino cuenta sat√©lite de turismo aplicado a la compilaci√≥n de algunas de las Tablas ser√≠a err√≥neo.\nEn la CST-A se elaboraron las Tablas 6 para cada a√±o de la serie. En 2004 y 2018 con base en los COU de las cuentas nacionales, mientras que para los a√±os 2016, 2017 y 2019, ante la inexistencia de los COU nacionales, se realizaron con base en estimaciones de COU reducidas para las industrias caracter√≠sticas del turismo.\nBloque 4: ampliaciones a la CST\nEn el Bloque 4: ampliaciones a la CST, el CST:RMC, 2008 presenta 4 Tablas adicionales como propuesta para ampliaciones de la CST, sin que ellas integren el cuerpo principal de CST.\n\nEn la Tabla 7 se da cuenta del empleo en las industrias tur√≠sticas y es de importancia estrat√©gica por el alto impacto del turismo en los puestos de trabajo. La propuesta del CST:RMC, 2008 es limitar el estudio de la industria del turismo, o sea a las ramas de actividad caracter√≠sticas, a expensas de que una parte de la producci√≥n no est√° destinada al consumo de los visitantes (y/o parte del consumo no producido por estas).\nEsta recomendaci√≥n fue atendida en la CST-A, donde se elabor√≥ la Tabla 7 para todos los a√±os de la serie, en puestos de trabajo seg√∫n la condici√≥n de ocupaci√≥n (asalariado registrado, asalariado no registrado y no asalariado) para la industria del turismo caracter√≠stica en la Argentina.\nOtros indicadores de empleo por fuera de los elaborados en la CST-A, como aproximaciones al empleo generado por el consumo de los visitantes, se pueden obtener de combinar los ratios tur√≠sticos de la producci√≥n (Tabla 6) y los puestos de trabajo de las industrias tur√≠sticas y no tur√≠stica (Tabla 7).\nEn esta primera etapa, en la CST-A no se elaboraron la Tabla 8, sobre la formaci√≥n bruta de capital fijo tur√≠stico y la Tabla 9, de consumo colectivo tur√≠stico, por falta de informaci√≥n de base disponible con el detalle requerido. Aun as√≠, como se advirti√≥ anteriormente, estas ampliaciones no contribuyen a los indicadores de impacto econ√≥mico del turismo (VABDT, PIBDT) que para la CST:RMC 2008 se limita al consumo de los visitantes y por lo tanto se completa en la Tabla 6.\nLos invitamos a recorrer la CST-A:\nPara las Tablas e indicadores del a√±o 2004 (en Excel): CST-A 2004\nPara las Tablas e indicadores del a√±o 2018 (en Excel): CST-A 2018\nA medida que se elaboren los COU de las cuentas nacionales, iremos actualizando las Tablas detalladas de cada CST-A anual. El pr√≥ximo pas√≥ ser√° difundir las de la CST-A de 2019 junto con los avances de indicadores s√≠ntesis para los a√±os 2020 y 2021.\nSiglas y abreviaturas\nCOU: Cuadros oferta y utilizaci√≥n\nCST: Cuenta Sat√©lite de Turismo\nVABDT: valor agregado bruto directo tur√≠stico\nPIBDT: producto interior bruto directo tur√≠stico\nVBPIT: valor bruto de producci√≥n de la industria del turismo\nVABIT: _valor agregado de la industria del turismo\nCST-A: Cuenta Sat√©lite de Turismo de la Argentina\nCST:RMC, 2008: Cuenta Sat√©lite de Turismo: Recomendaciones sobre el Marco Conceptual 2008, Estudios de m√©todos, F(80) (ONU 2010)\nETI: Encuesta de Turismo Internacional\nEVyTH: Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares\nRecursos - CST-A\nPublicaci√≥n\nDocumento T√©cnico #5: Medici√≥n de la contribuci√≥n econ√≥mica del turismo\n\nAqu√≠ no profundizaremos m√°s en estas definiciones y clasificaciones de actividades y productos, pero para aquellos que quieran interiorizarse lo invitamos a consultar el Documento T√©cnico N¬∞5: Medici√≥n de la contribuci√≥n econ√≥mica del turismo.‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",

En esta oportunidad, se pone a disposici√≥n el informe de Turismo de Cultura, un conjunto de estad√≠sticas relacionadas con las pr√°cticas tur√≠sticas en entornos culturales.\n\nAcceso al informe\n\nLas principales fuentes de informaci√≥n con la que se elabor√≥ el informe, sea para el turismo nacional como el internacional, son:\nLa Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH), a partir de la cual se releva informaci√≥n sociodemogr√°fica de los residentes en argentina y de las principales caraceter√≠sticas de sus viajes.\nLa Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI), en donde se indaga sobre los principales aspectos de las y los viajeros residentes en el exterior.\n¬øQu√© se entiende por Turismo de Cultura?\nSeg√∫n la Organizaci√≥n Mundial del Turismo\n\nEl turismo cultural es un tipo de actividad tur√≠stica en el que la motivaci√≥n esencial del visitante es aprender, descubrir, disfrutar y consumir los atractivos/productos materiales e inmateriales de un destino tur√≠stico. Estos atractivos/productos guardan relaci√≥n con un conjunto de elementos materiales, intelectuales, espirituales y emocionales distintivos de una sociedad, entre ellos las artes y la arquitectura, el patrimonio hist√≥rico y cultural, el patrimonio gastron√≥mico, la literatura, la m√∫sica, las industrias creativas y las culturas vivas, con sus estilos de vida, sistemas de valores, creencias y tradiciones. 1\n\nEn base a esta definici√≥n y con las fuentes disponibles, se elabor√≥ la siguiente operacionalizaci√≥n:\nSeg√∫n la ETI, se pueden consideran las siguientes actividades:\nActividades culturales en lugares urbanos.\nAsistencia a eventos deportivos o culturales.\nActividades de tango.\nActividades vinculadas al vino.\nActividades vinculadas con la gastronom√≠a.\nSeg√∫n la EVyTH, se consideran las siguientes actividades:\nAsistencia a actos o festividades religiosas.\nVisitas a teatros, cines, conciertos o recitales.\nVisitas a museos, monumentos, parques tem√°ticos, zool√≥gicos,

A√ëO 2019\nESTAD√çA Y GASTO PROMEDIO*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentaci√≥n\nEl turismo de naturaleza o turismo activo natural -que incluye al turismo aventura, el ecoturismo y otras pr√°cticas en las que la naturaleza ocupa un rol protag√≥nico- es un segmento estrat√©gico para el sector tur√≠stico de Argentina y uno de los de mayor crecimiento en nuestro pa√≠s y el mundo. Este crecimiento refleja una tendencia global en la que los destinos naturales, los espacios abiertos y las experiencias genuinas en √°mbitos silvestres, permiten a una poblaci√≥n crecientemente urbana reconectar con la naturaleza y ocupan un lugar central en la preferencia de los viajeros. La pandemia de Covid 19 no hizo m√°s que reafirmar esta tendencia.\nArgentina cuenta con un patrimonio natural incomparable, que explica gran parte del flujo tur√≠stico interno y receptivo. Este movimiento es una fuente de empleo y desarrollo econ√≥mico de gran relevancia para nuestro pa√≠s, y uno de los principales motores productivos de numerosas econom√≠as regionales. En este sentido, se encuentra en marcha un programa integral de turismo de naturaleza llamado La Ruta Natural, con el cual Argentina se propone desarrollar territorios y comunidades con respeto a los valores naturales y la autenticidad cultural, como as√≠ tambi√©n promocionar viajes seguros y turismo sustentable a partir del turismo de naturaleza en todo el territorio nacional.\nEs desde este marco que la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica del Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes de la Naci√≥n elabor√≥ un informe cuyo principal objetivo es caracterizar cuantitativamente los principales aspectos del Turismo de Naturaleza. Para esto se recurri√≥ a dos de las principales fuentes de informaci√≥n con la que se cuenta tanto para el turismo nacional como el internacional. En cuanto a la primera, la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH) releva informaci√≥n sociodemogr√°fica de los residentes en argentina y de las principales caraceter√≠sticas de sus viajes. La segunda, la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI), en donde se indaga sobre los principales aspectos de las y los viajeros residentes en el exterior.\n¬øQu√© se entiende por Turismo de Naturaleza seg√∫n la ETI y la EVyTH?\nSeg√∫n la ETI, se pueden consideran las siguientes actividades:\nTurismo aventura.\nActividades de baja diÔ¨Åcultad en medios naturales.\nVisita a parques nacionales.\nActividades en la nieve.\nSeg√∫n la EVyTH, se consideran las siguientes actividades:\nVisitaron espacios rurales como estancias, granjas, etc.\nVisitaron parques nacionales o provinciales, reservas, etc.\nHicieron esqu√≠, snowboard, u otro deporte de nieve.\nRealizaron deportes de aventura como mountain bike, monta√±ismo, rafting, traves√≠as, ala delta, etc.\nOtras actividades en espacios abiertos y naturales.\nPrincipales resultados\nTURISMO INTERNACIONAL\n\n\n\nPARTICIPACI√ìN ANUAL DE LOS TURISTAS QUE REALIZARON TURISMO DE NATURALEZA DURANTE SU VISITA A LA ARGENTINA\n\n\n\nPARTICIPACI√ìN DE LOS/LAS TURISTAS QUE REALIZARON TURISMO DE NATURALEZA POR PA√çS DE RESIDENCIA.

Es resultado de un proyecto conjunto de colaboraci√≥n entre de la DNMyE-MINTURDEP y la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Cuentas Nacionales del Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos (DNCN-INDEC).\nEn una secci√≥n espec√≠fica del Sistema de Informaci√≥n Tur√≠stica de la Argentina (SINTA) se puede acceder al informe t√©cnico con informaci√≥n de los a√±os 2004 y 2016-2019, el documento metodol√≥gico y los principales cuadros estad√≠sticos.\nEs el corolario de los a√±os invertidos en el desarrollo del Sistema de Estad√≠sticas de Turismo de la Argentina que consta de un conjunto de operaciones estad√≠sticas e investigaciones, principalmente integrado por:\nLa Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI)\nLa Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH)\nLa Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera y parahotelera (EOH)\nLa explotaci√≥n de gran cantidad de registros administrativos (datos de tr√°nsitos de migraciones internacionales, visitas a los parques nacionales, precios, peajes, etc).\nEl Sistema de Estad√≠sticas de Turismo se integr√≥ a las cuentas nacionales de la Argentina elaboradas por el INDEC, que aport√≥ las cuentas de producci√≥n para los sectores tur√≠sticos y los cuadros de oferta y utilizaci√≥n, con su reciente actualizaci√≥n al a√±o 2018, que son la base para la estimaci√≥n de la serie de la CST-A.\n¬øQu√© es la CST?\nEs la herramienta recomendada por la Organizaci√≥n Mundial del Turismo, y reconocida por la comunidad internacional, para evaluar la importancia econ√≥mica del turismo, conocer las industrias que se benefician de la llegada de visitantes, cuantificar el valor agregado directo que se genera al satisfacer la demanda tur√≠stica y la generaci√≥n de empleo, entre otros. Actualmente 54 pa√≠ses tienen una Cuenta Sat√©lite de Turismo con actualizaci√≥n reciente. De ellos, 4 son sudamericanos: Colombia, Ecuador, Per√∫ y Uruguay1.\nEl prop√≥sito de la CST-A es analizar minuciosamente todos los aspectos de la demanda de bienes y servicios asociados con la actividad de los visitantes argentinos y extranjeros que recorren nuestro pa√≠s. Los principales resultados que muestra son una serie de indicadores econ√≥micos consistentes con las Cuentas Nacionales. Estos son:\nProducto interno bruto directo tur√≠stico (PIBDT): se trata de la producci√≥n de bienes y servicios que se genera directamente por el consumo de los visitantes, sin importar la industria que los produjo. Surge de contrastar el consumo total de los visitantes (tur√≠stico interno y receptor) con la producci√≥n del pa√≠s.\nValor agregado bruto directo tur√≠stico (VABDT): corresponde a la parte del valor agregado bruto generado por todas las industrias de una econom√≠a, ya sean tur√≠sticas o no, que atendieron directamente al consumo de los visitantes.\nValor agregado bruto de la industria del turismo (VABIT): se refiere al Valor Agregado (es decir, la producci√≥n total excluyendo los consumos intermedios o insumos) de un conjunto de ramas de actividad que se consideran caracter√≠sticas del turismo (Gastronom√≠a, Alojamiento, Transporte, Agencias de Viaje, Actividades de Entretenimiento, Culturales y Deportivas, entre otras).\nEmpleo de la industria del turismo: corresponde al total de puestos de trabajo de las ramas de actividad caracter√≠sticas del turismo.\nPrincipales resultados de la CST-A\nConsumo Tur√≠stico Interior\nEl consumo tur√≠stico interior es el que realizan los visitantes para la adquisici√≥n de bienes o servicios en sus viajes m√°s los otros consumos imputados. En la CST-A, se analizan distintos aspectos del gasto tur√≠stico, seg√∫n la residencia de los visitantes:\n‚Ä¢ Gasto Tur√≠stico Receptor: referido a los visitantes no residentes en la Argentina.\n‚Ä¢ Gasto Tur√≠stico Interno: referido a visitantes residentes en la Argentina.\n\n\n\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica

En este sentido, no se tienen en cuenta otros efectos (indirectos o inducidos hacia otras ramas de la econom√≠a) asi como el gasto de capital y el consumo de gobierno relativos al turismo. Estos aspectos, asi como diferencias en la forma de medir los componentes directos, explican las discrepancias con mediciones alternativas del impacto del turismo en la econom√≠a (v.g. la medici√≥n del Consejo Mundial de Viajes y Turismo -WTTC-)\nA continuaci√≥n, se presenta el PIBdt y el VABdt para los a√±os en an√°lisis, tanto en pesos corrientes como en porcentaje de participaci√≥n sobre el PIB de la econom√≠a total.\n\n\n\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial,

Dicho operativo brinda informaci√≥n cont√≠nua del turismo nacional de la Argentina, tanto de los viajes tur√≠sticos de los residentes dentro de nuestro territorio nacional como los realizados en el exterior1.\nEn esta instancia ya contamos con la actualizaci√≥n de los datos hasta la √∫ltima informaci√≥n disponible, que permiten generar los principales indicadores referidos al Turismo Interno. De esta forma, la base completa comprende informaci√≥n trimestral que va desde el 1er trimestre de 2019 hasta el 3er trimestre de 2021, inclusive. El pr√≥ximo paso ser√° completar la serie desde el inicio de la EVyTH como operativo continuo.\nUna de las principales ventajas de contar con base de microdatos es poder obtener informaci√≥n que responda a objetivos espec√≠ficos por parte del o la usuaria y que no est√© necesariamente inclu√≠da en los informes publicados por la Direcci√≥n de Mercados y Estad√≠stica.\n\n\n\nIndicadores.\nPara conocer las caracter√≠sticas principales de la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares se puede acceder a la ficha t√©cnica, tambi√©n publicada en el portal.\nLos ejercicios propuestos fueron procesados mediante el lenguaje de programaci√≥n R. Entre las principales razones por las cuales se opta por esta alternativa se encuentran la de ser software libre y de c√≥digo abierto, su potencia para el procesamiento sistem√°tico de datos y capacidad para desarrollar visualizaci√≥nes a medida 2.\nAl mismo tiempo, los resultaros se obtuvieron a trav√©s del procesamiento de la base de microdatos disponible en el Portal de Datos Abiertos donde tambi√©n se accede a un diccionario de registro, del cual podemos obtener el conjunto de etiquetas para cada una de las variables y sus respectivas categor√≠as.\nA continuaci√≥n, presentaremos algunas visualizaciones que funcionan como ejemplo del tipo de ejercicios que se puede realizar a partir de la base de microdatos.\n\n\n\nRanking provincial seg√∫n la cantidad de viajeros que recibieron.\nSe propone en este ejercicio analizar el turismo interno a trav√©s del conteo de visitantes que recibieron las provincias y comparar c√≥mo se modifica la posici√≥n relativa de cada una de ellas a lo largo de los a√±os 2019, 2020 y 2021.\n\n\n\nEl primer paso para obtener el ranking fue elegir los a√±os de los cuales se cuenta informaci√≥n y un trimestre particular (el √∫ltimo disponible) para poder hacer una comparaci√≥n sin tener en cuenta el efecto estacionalidad. Luego se realiz√≥ un conteo de personas en funci√≥n de la provincia de destino del viaje. Para visualizar la informaci√≥n procesada se utiliz√≥ el paquete de R {ggbump}, con el que se pueden crear gr√°ficos de clasificaci√≥n (bump chart) y que nos permiten mostrar la posici√≥n relativa de ciertos elementos a lo largo del tiempo. Con ello se logran tres ejes, con los a√±os analizados y la posici√≥n de asume cada una de las provincias a lo largo del tiempo.\nAglomerado de or√≠gen de los viajeros que ingresaron a la Provincia de Salta\nPara un segundo ejemplo, se elig√≥ a la provincia de Salta como destino y se realiz√≥ un conteo de la cantidad de personas que visitaron dicha provincia, por un lado, en funci√≥n del aglomerado de or√≠gen de dichos visitantes. De esta forma, en el gr√°fico se podr√°n visualizar dos ejes: a la derecha, la provincia de destino con el conteo de la cantidad de personas que recibi√≥. A la izquierda, el aglomerado de or√≠gen de las personas que viajaron al destino en cuesti√≥n, con el peso relativo de cada uno respecto al total.\n\n\n\nEl resultado de esta visualizaci√≥n permite ver cu√°les son los principales aglomerados que contribuyen al turismo de una provincia determinada. En particular, vemos como en la Provincia de Salta, para el 3er trimestre de 2021, cerca del 75% de sus visitantes provienen del aglomerado Salta. Muy por detr√°s, en un segundo lugar se ubica el aglomerado Gran Tucum√°n - Taf√≠ Viejo, representando un 7% del total de viajeros en el peri√≥do de referencia.\nAglomerado de or√≠gen de los viajeros que ingresaron a la ciudad San Carlos de Bariloche\nPor √∫ltimo, en el siguiente ejemplo se muestra c√≥mo, adem√°s de una provincia, se puede elegir como destino a una localidad. En este caso, se tom√≥ a la ciudad San Carlos de Bariloche para enteder cu√°les son los principales aglomerados de or√≠gen de los visitantes que deciden viajar a la ciudad.\n\n\n\nEl resultado evidencia una diversidad de aglomerados de or√≠gen de los viajeros. En primer lugar, separado del resto, se observa a los Partidos del GBA, con un 44% de las personas que decidieron viajar a S.C de Bariloche. En segundo lugar se puede ver como Bah√≠a Blanca aporta una buena porci√≥n de los viajeros (14%), seguida del aglomerado Gran San Juan (11%) y Neuqu√©n - Plottier (7%).\nRecursos - Turismo Interno / Microdatos\nDataset\nFicha metodol√≥gica\nDatos Abiertos\nInformes\nReportes\n\nM√°s informaci√≥n disponible en el Documento T√©cnico #1 del proyecto de Armonizaci√≥n.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nEl c√≥digo fuente para reproducir el ejercicio aqu√≠ propuesto se puede acceder a trav√©s del repositorio de la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Mercados y Estad√≠stica - MINTURDEP.‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",

Se podr√° seguir peri√≥dicamente estos indicadores aqu√≠, con el agregado de gr√°ficos interactivos.\n\nIntroducci√≥n\nLa reciente publicaci√≥n de nuevos datasets por parte del Ministerio de Desarrollo Productivo (MDP) en su portal de datos abiertos permite profundizar el an√°lisis del sector tur√≠stico en Argentina en t√©rminos de empleo registrado, ya que cuenta con informaci√≥n de puestos de trabajo, puestos por g√©nero, empleadores, entre otros, con la m√°xima apertura de rama de actividad de la clasificaci√≥n de AFIP. Este √∫ltimo aspecto resulta clave a la hora de seleccionar las Ramas Caracter√≠sticas del Turismo (RCT) de acuerdo a las recomendaciones de la Organizaci√≥n Mundial del Turismo (OMT). En sus Recomendaciones internacionales para estad√≠sticas de turismo 2008, se√±ala que las actividades caracter√≠sticas del turismo son aquellas que producen productos caracter√≠sticos del turismo, siendo estos aquellos que cumplen uno o ambos de los siguientes criterios:\nEl gasto tur√≠stico en el producto deber√≠a representar una parte importante del gasto total tur√≠stico (condici√≥n de la proporci√≥n que corresponde al gasto/demanda)\nEl gasto tur√≠stico en el producto deber√≠a representar una parte importante de la oferta del producto en la econom√≠a (condici√≥n de la proporci√≥n que corresponde a la oferta). Este criterio supone que la oferta de un producto caracter√≠stico del turismo se reducir√≠a considerablemente si no hubiera visitantes.\nUna adecuada selecci√≥n de las ramas caracter√≠sticas requiere, por un lado, de un an√°lisis del gasto tur√≠stico en t√©rminos de productos y su contrastaci√≥n con la oferta generada. Por otro lado, la desagregaci√≥n de las ramas es fundamental para excluir actividades que, tomadas de manera agregada, pueden contener en su interior ramas tur√≠sticas y ramas no tur√≠sticas. El caso del transporte sirve como ejemplo. La actividad Transporte automotor incluye tanto el servicio de cargas como el de pasajeros, por lo que no ser√≠a preciso incluirla completamente entre las RCT. A su vez, el Transporte automotor de pasajeros incluye, entre otros, los servicios urbano e interurbano, mientras que s√≥lo el segundo es considerado tur√≠stico. Por lo tanto, deber√≠a excluirse el Servicio de transporte automotor urbano de pasajeros. Para que esto sea posible es necesario contar con las ramas de actividad abiertas a 5 d√≠gitos del clasificador de AFIP. Es por esto que la nueva publicaci√≥n a 6 d√≠gitos es de gran valor para el an√°lisis del sector.\nEsta perspectiva implica analizar al sector desde el punto de vista de la oferta. Esto es, la selecci√≥n de las RCT que cumplen con los criterios anteriores no tiene en cuenta si una parte de la producci√≥n no es consumida por visitantes. El caso de los servicios de provisi√≥n de alimentos y bebidas es un ejemplo de esta limitaci√≥n.\nEn este sentido, se pude consultar el Docum√©nto T√©cnico #5 elaborado por la Direcci√≥n, en el que, en el marco del Proyecto de Armonizaci√≥n de las Estad√≠sticas Provinciales de Turismo, se abordan propuestas metodol√≥gicas para la medici√≥n de la actividad econ√≥mica del turismo desde la perspectiva de la oferta.\nLa metodolog√≠a de las series elaboradas por el MDP se encuentra aqu√≠.1\nRamas seleccionadas\nPara el presente documento se seleccionaron 56 ramas de actividad a 6 d√≠gitos de CLAE (ver Anexo), agrup√°ndolas en 5 categor√≠as:\nAgencias de Viaje: 4 ramas.\nAlojamiento: 5 ramas.\nGastronom√≠a: 9 ramas.\nTransporte: 12 ramas.\nOtros Servicios Tur√≠sticos: 26 ramas.\nAclaraci√≥n: Debido a la preservaci√≥n del secreto estad√≠stico, las ramas con 2 o menos empleadores no contienen informaci√≥n. Actualmente, entonces, no se incluye informaci√≥n sobre:\nServicio de transporte ferroviario interurbano de pasajeros\n\n\n\n\n\nPuestos de trabajo\nA continuaci√≥n se muestra la evoluci√≥n de los puestos de trabajo registrados en ramas tur√≠sticas desde enero 2007 hasta junio 2021. En ella se puede observar el fuerte componente estacional del sector. Por otro lado, se observa una tendencia creciente desde inicios de la serie hasta el a√±o 2018. En ese per√≠odo los puestos de trabajo inician en valores cercanos a 330.000 hasta llegar al m√°ximo de 492.000 puestos en enero de 2018. La tendencia es decreciente a partir del a√±o 2019 y se profundiza desde el inicio de la pandemia, llegando actualmente a niveles similares a los del inicio de la serie. A su vez, los puestos de trabajo en el total de la econom√≠a tuvieron una evoluci√≥n similar en su participaci√≥n, representando alrededor del 6% en el a√±o 2007 para llegar a m√°ximos en torno al 7% y actualmente retroceder por debajo del 6%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategor√≠as\nComo se mencion√≥ anteriormente, puede agruparse a las ramas tur√≠sticas en 5 categor√≠as (Agencias de Viaje, Alojamiento, Gastronom√≠a, Transporte, Otros Servicios Tur√≠sticos) y observar la evoluc√≥n comparada. All√≠ vemos que la Gastronom√≠a gana participaci√≥n en el total, pasando -aproximadamente- del 36% al 40%. La categor√≠a transporte, a su vez, toma valores decrecientes desde valores cercanos al 22% y al 19% a lo largo de la serie. La categor√≠a Otros Servicios Tur√≠sticos, a su vez, mantiene valores en torno al 22% de participaci√≥n. La categor√≠a Alojamiento, por su parte, reduce su participaci√≥n desde el 14-15% al 13%. Las Agencias de Viaje tienen una participaci√≥n minoritaria en el empleo del sector, en torno al 4%\n\n\n\nTodas las RCT\nPuede observarse, a su vez, la evoluci√≥n de los puestos de trabajo tomando cada rama a 6 d√≠gitos individualmente, para observar al interior de las categor√≠as tur√≠sticas. Cada l√≠nea gris es una rama a 6 d√≠gitos y el grosor de cada una depende del peso que tiene el empleo promedio de todo el per√≠odo en esa rama sobre el total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuestos por g√©nero\nLos datos abiertos por el MDP incluyen la apertura por g√©nero de los puestos de trabajo registrados en todas las ramas a 6 d√≠gitos, lo que permite ver la participaci√≥n de las mujeres/varones en las ramas tur√≠sticas en comparaci√≥n con el resto de las ramas.\nRCT vs NO RCT\nSe observa en primer lugar, que las ramas tur√≠sticas, tomadas en su conjunto, tienen un porcentaje mayor de mujeres en el total de puestos de trabajo. A su vez, la participaci√≥n femenina es creciente (al menos hasta el inicio de la pandemia), pasando del 36% al 39% a lo largo de la serie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategor√≠as\nObservando al interior de las ramas tur√≠sticas, se observa una gran heterogeneidad en la participaci√≥n femenina en los puestos de trabajo registrados. Mientras que las categor√≠as Alojamiento y Agencias de Viaje presentan una participaci√≥n mayor al 50%, Gastronom√≠a y Otros Servicios Tur√≠sticos est√°n en torno al 40%, por encima de las ramas no tur√≠sticas. Por √∫ltimo, la categor√≠a Transporte presenta una muy baja participaci√≥n femenina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTodas las ramas\nLa disparidad en la participaci√≥n de las mujeres en RCT puede verse incluso al interior de las categor√≠as. A continuaci√≥n se presenta la evoluci√≥n de la tasa de feminizaci√≥n de los puestos de trabajo en todas las ramas tur√≠sticas, agrupadas por categor√≠as. Cada l√≠nea gris es una rama a 6 d√≠gitos y el grosor de cada una depende del peso que tiene el empleo promedio de todo el per√≠odo en esa rama sobre el total.\n\n\n\nEmpresas\nLa informaci√≥n del MDP incluye, adem√°s, a las empresas que declararon trabajadores en el mes de referencia, agrupadas tambi√©n en ramas a 6 d√≠gitos. A continuaci√≥n se presenta la evoluci√≥n de este indicador en ramas tur√≠sticas. En l√≠nea con la evoluci√≥n de los puestos de trabajo, se observa un fuerte crecimiento al inicio de la serie, que comienza con alrededor de 40.000 empresas, llegando a m√°ximos de m√°s de 52.000 en las temporadas altas del per√≠odo 2014-2018, para luego retroceder a valores cercanos al inicio de la serie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpresas por categor√≠a\nIngresando al interior de las RCT, puede observarse la creciente participaci√≥n de las empresas gastron√≥micas, en detrimento de la categor√≠a Transporte.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTodas las ramas\nAl igual que con los puestos de trabajo y la participaci√≥n por g√©nero, la cantidad de empresas puede observarse para todas las ramas tur√≠sticas a 6 d√≠gitos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsideraciones finales\nComo se intent√≥ mostrar en el presente documento, los datos recientemente publicados permiten un enriquecedor an√°lisis del sector tur√≠stico en t√©rminos de empleo registrado, ya que la apertura a 6 d√≠gitos permite seleccionar adecuadamente las ramas caracter√≠sicas. A su vez, la posiblidad de ver la participaci√≥n por g√©nero en los puestos de trabajo es un dato novedoso para esta fuente de datos (SIPA) y la cantidad de empresas provee otro indicador para seguir el nivel de actividad del sector. A las posibles extensiones de este an√°lisis con los datos presentados se agrega la disponibilidad de datos sobre salarios medios y medianos por rama a 6 d√≠gitos que ser√°n analizados en posteriores entregas.\nAnexo\nRamas seleccionadas\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"caption\":\"<caption>Ramas seleccionadas y valores dejunio 2021<\\/caption>\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\",\"21\",\"22\",\"23\",\"24\",\"25\",\"26\",\"27\",\"28\",\"29\",\"30\",\"31\",\"32\",\"33\",\"34\",\"35\",\"36\",\"37\",\"38\",\"39\",\"40\",\"41\",\"42\",\"43\",\"44\",\"45\",\"46\",\"47\",\"48\",\"49\",\"50\",\"51\",\"52\",\"53\",\"54\",\"55\",\"56\"],[491120,492120,492150,492160,492170,492180,501100,502101,511000,524110,524330,551021,551022,551023,551090,552000,561011,561012,561013,561014,561019,561020,561030,561040,562099,591300,592000,771110,791100,791200,791901,791909,854950,854960,900011,900021,900030,900040,900091,910100,910200,910300,910900,920001,920009,931010,931020,931030,931041,931042,931050,931090,939010,939020,939030,939090],[\"Servicio de transporte ferroviario interurbano de pasajeros\",\"Servicios de transporte automotor de pasajeros mediante taxis y remises, alquiler de autos con chofer (Incluye los radiotaxis)\",\"Servicio de transporte automotor interurbano regular de pasajeros, excepto transporte internacional (Incluye los llamados servicios de larga distancia)\",\"Servicio de transporte automotor interurbano no regular de pasajeros \",\"Servicio de transporte automotor internacional de pasajeros \",\"Servicio de transporte automotor tur√≠stico de pasajeros \",\"Servicio de transporte mar√≠timo de pasajeros\",\"Servicio de transporte fluvial y lacustre de pasajeros\",\"Servicio de transporte a√©reo de pasajeros\",\"Servicios de explotaci√≥n de infraestructura para el transporte terrestre, peajes y otros derechos\",\"Servicios para la aeronavegaci√≥n (Incluye remolque de aeronaves y actividades de control de tr√°fico a√©reo, etc.)\",\"Servicios de alojamiento en pensiones\",\"Servicios de alojamiento en hoteles, hoster√≠as y residenciales similares, excepto por hora, que incluyen servicio de restaurante al p√∫blico\",\"Servicios de alojamiento en hoteles, hoster√≠as y residenciales similares, excepto por hora, que no incluyen servicio de restaurante al p√∫blico\",\"Servicios de hospedaje temporal n.c.p.

En una segunda secci√≥n se muestra la comparaci√≥n de estos datos con los que provee la estimaci√≥n de la Balanza de Pagos.\n¬øQu√© es el turismo en el MULC?\nEl BCRA publica las estad√≠sticas de las transacciones realizadas a trav√©s del MULC clasificadas dentro de la Cuenta Corriente, Cuenta Capital y Cuenta Financiera cambiarias. Dentro de la Cuenta Corriente, a su vez, se distingue entre operaciones de bienes y de servicios. Dentro de esta √∫ltima categor√≠a pueden seleccionarse dos rubros vinculados al turismo:\nViajes y otros pagos con tarjeta, que incluye todas las transacciones internacionales realizadas por operadores tur√≠sticos locales, la compra/venta de divisas en billetes por parte de personas no residentes, los ingresos de divisas por compras realizadas por personas no residentes con tarjetas de cr√©dito dentro de Argentina y los egresos de divisas por compras realizadas por residentes con tarjeta de cr√©dito en el exterior. Aqu√≠ cabe aclarar que no todas las transacciones con tarjeta de cr√©dito corresponden a compras realizadas durante un viaje tur√≠stico, sino que pueden corresponder, por ejemplo, a compras con env√≠o internacional o compras de servicios de streaming. Es importante tener en cuenta esta aclaraci√≥n, dado que durante este informe nos referiremos a turismo y estos pagos estar√°n incluidos dentro de ese concepto.\nServicios de transporte de pasajeros, que incluye los ingresos de divisas por la compra de pasajes internacionales por parte de no residentes a empresas de transporte residentes y los egresos de divisas por la compra de pasajes internacionales por parte de residentes a empresas de transporte no residentes.\nDe esta manera se puede analizar la evoluci√≥n mensual de los ingresos y egresos de divisas por turismo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA su vez, se puede observar el aporte de los rubros tur√≠sticos al total de servicios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn la comparaci√≥n con el resto de los rubros, vemos que, en el mes de agosto 2021, el turismo ocup√≥ el puesto 9¬∞ dentro de los ingresos de divisas por servicios y el puesto 2¬∞ para los egresos.\n\n\n\nA su vez, se puede ver la evoluci√≥n mensual de los conceptos que componen el rubro ‚ÄúViajes y otros pagos con tarjeta‚Äù.\nSeg√∫n la apertura del rubro ‚ÄúViajes y otros pagos con tarjeta‚Äù, se observa que tanto los ingresos como los egresos de divisas est√°n principalmente explicados por las compras con tarjetas y en menor medida por las transacciones de los operadores tur√≠sticos locales.\nEn cuanto al rubro ‚ÄúBilletes - No Residentes‚Äù, los ingresos de divisas por este motivo (cambio de divisas por pesos argentinos realizado por turistas no residentes) es pr√°cticamente nulo desde abril de 2020, mientras que los egresos (cambio de pesos argentinos por divisas) es pr√°cticamente nulo desde noviembre de 2019. En ambos casos, impact√≥ fundamentalmente la imposibilidad de operaci√≥n de las casas de cambio como producto de las medidas de aislamiento social preventivo y obligatorio a partir de fines de marzo de 2020, y en el caso particular de los egresos, adem√°s impactaron las medidas de restricci√≥n cambiarias desde noviembre de 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMULC vs Balanza de Pagos\nLa Balanza de Pagos (‚ÄúBP‚Äù) contiene, dentro de la cuenta corriente, dos cuentas vinculadas al turismo: ‚ÄúCuenta Viajes‚Äù y ‚ÄúCuenta Transporte de Pasajeros‚Äù. La Cuenta Viajes estima, en el cr√©dito, el total de los ingresos monetarios debidos al turismo receptivo y, en el d√©bito, el total de los egresos monetarios producidos por el turismo emisivo. Por su lado, la Cuenta Transporte de Pasajeros estima, en el cr√©dito, los ingresos monetarios por las compras de pasajes internacionales que realizaron personas no residentes a empresas residentes en Argentina y, en el d√©bito, los egresos monetarios por la compra de pasajes internacionales por parte de personas residentes en Argentina a empresas residentes en el exterior.\nDado que el MULC registra los ingresos/egresos de divisas v√≠a el mercado oficial de cambios, en esta secci√≥n del informe se realiza una comparaci√≥n entre las transacciones registradas por el MULC y el total estimado por la BP, a fin de conocer qu√© parte del turismo est√° generando divisas en el mercado formal, y qu√© parte se est√° volcando al mercado informal de cambios (mercado ‚Äúnegro‚Äù o ‚Äúblue‚Äù).\nDado que la informaci√≥n de la BP se presenta una vez por trimestre, la comparaci√≥n se realiza agrupando por trimestres los datos del BCRA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa proporci√≥n de los ingresos canalizados v√≠a el mercado oficial es inusualmente alta en la actualidad con respecto a la historia reciente. La reducci√≥n de la movilidad de las personas y los cambios de comportamiento de los turistas, como producto de la pandemia, promovieron un mayor uso de tarjetas de cr√©dito y el menor acceso a casas de cambio informales, aumentando la proporci√≥n de ingresos por turismo percibida por el MULC 1.\n\n\n\nAl igual que los ingresos, los egresos tambi√©n muestran un comportamiento inusual en los √∫ltimos trimestres2.\n\n\n\n\nRecurso - Turismo en el MULC\nReporte\n\nEs importante notar que los ingresos por turismo, a trav√©s del mercado oficial de cambios (MULC), siempre deber√≠an ser menores, o al menos iguales, al total de ingresos por turismo que percibe la Argentina seg√∫n la Balanza de Pagos. Sin embargo, en los trimestres 2, 3 y 4 del a√±o 2020 la proporci√≥n MULC/BP es mayor al 100%. Esto es debido a las diferencias en cuanto a la metodolog√≠a de registraci√≥n de ambas fuentes de informaci√≥n y los desfasajes en la vuelta de los turistas no residentes a sus lugares de origen, producto de las restricciones al tr√°nsito internacional por la pandemia por el virus COVID-19.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nNuevamente, los egresos por turismo a trav√©s del mercado oficial de cambios (MULC) siempre deber√≠an ser menores, o al menos iguales, al total de egresos por turismo de la Argentina seg√∫n la Balanza de Pagos. Sin embargo, en repetidas ocasiones esto no es as√≠, especialmente en los trimestres 2, 3 y 4 del a√±o 2020 y el 1er trimestre del 2021. En el caso de los egresos, sucede que el componente tur√≠stico del MULC incluye pagos con tarjeta realizados por residentes en Argentina a residentes en el exterior y que pueden no ser gastos tur√≠sticos. Ejemplos de esto podr√≠an ser los pagos de servicios de streaming. Por lo tanto, en los casos en que el ratio MULC/BP es mayor al 100% se evidencia que los gastos con tarjeta por motivos no tur√≠sticos aumentaron la componente ‚Äúviajes y otros gastos con tarjeta‚Äù del MULC por encima de los gastos del turismo emisivo registrado por la BP. En los trimestres comprendidos en la pandemia por COVID-19, esta situaci√≥n se refleja a√∫n m√°s debido a la reducci√≥n de cercana al 100% i.a. del turismo emisivo.‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",

Todas las metodolog√≠as utilizadas y criterios adoptados en cada una de las estad√≠sticas que producimos se basan en las recomendaciones internacionales de la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de Turismo (OMT).\nTableros y Reportes\nEl micrositio TABLEROS y REPORTES reune una serie de recursos que tienen como objetivo facilitar el acceso a los √∫ltimos datos disponibles de una multiplicidad de indicadores del turismo en Argentina.\nReportes\nTurismo Internacional: presenta la √∫ltima informaci√≥n de turismo receptivo y emisivo y balanza tur√≠stica por todas las v√≠as (a√©reo, terrestre y fluvial / mar√≠timo)..\nOcupaci√≥n Hotelera: presenta los √∫ltimos datos disponibles de la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH).\nNaturaleza: presenta informaci√≥n de visitas a Parques Nacionales del pa√≠s en base al Registro Nacional de Autorizaciones, Recaudaciones e Infracciones (RENARI) de la Administraci√≥n de Parques Nacionales.\nTurismo Interno: Reporte de los √∫ltimos datos estimados por la Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH).\nTableros\nPUNA\nEl Padr√≥n √önico Nacional de Alojamiento (PUNA) re√∫ne todos los establecimientos de alojamiento tur√≠stico de la Argentina, en el que se detallan las principales variables de cada uno, nutrido a partir de diferentes fuentes de informaci√≥n:\nlos organismos provinciales y municipales de turismo, que a trav√©s de su √°rea de fiscalizaci√≥n de servicios tur√≠sticos elaboran el padr√≥n de alojamiento de su provincia o localidad;\nel INDEC, a trav√©s de la Encuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH);\nfuentes secundarias especializadas en turismo relevadas desde la DNMYE - MINTURDEP.\nEl tablero PUNA pone a disposici√≥n informaci√≥n hist√≥rica (2014 - 2019) que da cuenta de: cantidades de (a) Establecimientos; (b) Unidades; (c) Habitaciones y (d) Plazas registradas a distintos niveles de agregaci√≥n (Ruta, Regi√≥n, Provincia, Departamento o Localidad), seg√∫n Clasificaci√≥n y Tipo de establecimiento (hotelero, parahotelero, privados y otros colectivos)4.\nTURISMO INTERNACIONAL\nEl tablero presenta las estimaciones mensuales del turismo internacional -receptivo y emisivo- de la totalidad de los pasos fronterizos del pa√≠s, desde el a√±o 2016 hasta la actualidad. La informaci√≥n estad√≠stica que se presenta, basada en los registros migratorios provistos por la Direcci√≥n Nacional de Migraciones (DNM) y en la Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI), se refiere al flujo de turistas no residentes que visitaron el pa√≠s y de los y las turistas residentes que viajaron al exterior, por todos los medios de transporte (a√©reo, fluvial/mar√≠timo y terrestre).\nPermite visualizar y descargar informaci√≥n detallada por a√±o, mes, medio de transporte, paso fronterizo (con el detalle de la provincia y del pa√≠s con el que limita el mismo), pa√≠s de residencia para el turismo receptivo y destino principal para turismo emisivo. De esta manera, el tablero constituye una herramienta amigable para el manejo de los datos estad√≠sticos de turismo internacional de nuestro pa√≠s. Actualmente se encuentra disponible informaci√≥n actualizada hasta julio de 2021.\nArmonizaci√≥n\nEl proyecto contempla una serie de actividades que incluye: diagn√≥stico de funcionamiento y capacidades de las oficinas a cargo de las estad√≠sticas de turismo en el pa√≠s; el desarrollo de materiales con propuestas te√≥ricas y metodol√≥gicas para el trabajo estad√≠stico de turismo a nivel subnacional; capacitaciones te√≥ricas y pr√°cticas a referentes t√©cnicos de estad√≠sticas; la creaci√≥n de un foro de intercambio permanente entre referntes t√©cnicos de los distintos niveles de gobierno; y la generaci√≥n de una herramienta de gesti√≥n de datos federal.\nActualizaci√≥n Metodol√≥gica\nEn primer lugar, el proyecto contempla la reedici√≥n y revisi√≥n peri√≥dica de una serie de documentos t√©cnicos que abordan otras problem√°ticas vinculadas a la producci√≥n de estad√≠stica de turismo:\nDocumento T√©cnico #1: Conceptos y elementos b√°sicos para la medici√≥n provincial de los turistas\nDocumento T√©cnico #2: Propuestas metodol√≥gicas para las encuestas de ocupaci√≥n en alojamientos tur√≠sticos\nDocumento T√©cnico #3: Descripci√≥n, an√°lisis y utilizaci√≥n de los Registros Administrativos para la medici√≥n del Turismo\nDocumento T√©cnico #4: Propuestas Metodol√≥gicas para las Encuestas de Perfil del Visitante\nDocumento T√©cnico #5: Medici√≥n de la contribuci√≥n econ√≥mica del turismo: actividad y empleo\nDocumento T√©cnico #6: Ciencia de Datos para el Turismo (en proceso)\nLos documentos metodol√≥gicos buscar√°n abordar las principales problem√°ticas a la hora de producir estad√≠sticas de turismo subnacionales como tambi√©n reforzar las definiciones y conceptos de turismo seg√∫n las recomendaciones internacionales.\nCapacitaciones\nEn una segunda instancia, se prev√© la capacitaci√≥n de puntos focales de los gobiernos subnacionales que tengan a cargo la administraci√≥n, generaci√≥n y/o an√°lisis de estad√≠sticas de turismo en sus respectivos distritos.\nLas capacitaciones pretenden nutrir y fortalecer a los referentes t√©cnicos provinciales para poder mejorar la producci√≥n de estad√≠sticas locales derivadas de los operativos de encuesta, explotaci√≥n de registros administrativos y otras fuentes de informaci√≥n utilizadas.\nSistema Federal de Gesti√≥n de Datos de Turismo\nEn paralelo, se procura desarrollar un sistema inform√°tico que permita ordenar, homogeneizar, jerarquizar y facilitar la administraci√≥n de registros, operativos estad√≠sticos y dem√°s datos relativos al sector tur√≠sticos de las distintas unidades administrativas.\nPara ello, se trabajar√° para la construcci√≥n de un Sistema Federal de Gesti√≥n de Datos de Turismo, herramienta que facilitar√° el acopio y gesti√≥n de datos producidos por los diferentes organismos de turismo subnacionales.\nEspacios de colaboraci√≥n e intercambio\nCon el fin de generar espacios de colaboraci√≥n entre los distintos actores vinculados a la producci√≥n y explotaci√≥n de las estad√≠sticas de turismo, se gestionar√° un foro permanente en donde se habilitar√°n distintos canales tem√°ticos que acompa√±ar√°n el contenido de este micrositio: documentos t√©cnicos, bibliograf√≠a y trabajos de inter√©s com√∫n.\nDe esta manera, el proyecto de Armonizaci√≥n contribuir√° a fortalecer las capacidades t√©cnicas, robustecer la producci√≥n de estad√≠sticas de turismo y promover una mayor sociabilizaci√≥n de la informaci√≥n producida por las distintas unidades administrativas de turismo.\nLes damos la bienvenida a la Bit√°cora, con la expectativa de que este espacio sea de utilidad para acercar el trabajo que se est√° llevando adelante desde el Ministerio de Turismo y Deportes.\n\nLa Encuesta de Viajes y Turismo de los Hogares (EVyTH) es un operativo realizado por el MINTURDEP, cuyo objetivo principal es proporcionar informaci√≥n sobre los viajes tur√≠sticos de los residentes de Argentina hacia dentro y fuera del pa√≠s: cu√°ndo viajan, a d√≥nde van, qu√© medios de transporte utilizan, d√≥nde se alojan, cu√°les son los motivos por los que viajan, c√≥mo organizan sus viajes, qu√© actividades tur√≠sticas realizan, cu√°nto gastan, etc.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nLa Encuesta de Turismo Internacional (ETI) es otro operativo realizado en forma continua desde el a√±o 2004, coordinado conjuntamente por el MINTURDEP y el INDEC.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nEncuesta de Ocupaci√≥n Hotelera (EOH) es un relevamiento realizado en forma continua desde el 2004, bajo la coordinaci√≥n del MINTURDEP y el Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠sticas y Censos (INDEC).‚Ü©Ô∏é\nLos datos publicados en el tablero PUNA, por su propia naturaleza, se encuentran en revisi√≥n continua y deben ser tomados como provisorios.‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",
